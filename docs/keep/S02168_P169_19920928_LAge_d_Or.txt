Music by Manu Di Bango Music by Manu Di Bango Music by Manu Di Bango Listen to the gold age. Music by Manu Di Bango The 60's were on the sidelines. Music by Manu Di Bango It's useless to dive for the year 1992. You have to go back a long way. Oh, Susy Q, Baby, Hello, View, it was from Credence, Clea Water, Revival, in a completely integral version. Attention, back with the sound of the 1970's. It's never been in my show on Monday after midi. My name is Bernard Sarlambault. Ask for the music. Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave. I'm sure this song has been around for 12 years. At least. The 1970's. 11 years old, 10 years old, 9 years old, 8 years old, even more. Funky Boogie, here's the completely weird voice. And Funky, the title of the Funky Boogie show by John Ozila. Here's the man who got a lot of tubes. John Ozila. Where are we? Where are we? In 1979, in 1992, we're back on this album. Vogue's record label, 33 tours, 20,000. Exclusive, Acidul FM. Thank you all so much. Here to tell the story of many alks. Three of us are al physical, Or our personal story's urgent. We are the real alks. We are the real alks. We are the real alks. M We are a że Oh Yeah Oh Funky bogey 1979 When the young people danced on this music in 1970 they are now what age now What was 18 years old? In 1972, Funky Bogey was 79 years old. The title of the song John Ozzy Here in a few moments you will go to the area of humor and the sound of the years 1950 it will be an exclusivity of Cabaret, the song club Oh A 33 turn of 2 centimeters around the thicknesses with the participation of Philippe Olive, but at the same time it is the title of this 33 long-distance turn Microcyon 33 turns on the disc brand of Decca and it's always the golden age that you hear Monday 15 hours 17 hours golden age You crack Ladies and gentlemen at the moment where the first septum of the fourth republic has just arrived in La Poteose While we see every day that everything is for the best in the best of the world And that under the pride and humble direction of our admirable politicians We begin to welcome the juicy fruits of their high culture and the tangible results of their so intelligent labor I thought it was a great time to make my mea culpa and by a kind of autocratic trying to fashion at the representatives of purest materialism to recognize how much I was both light, unintentional, sectarian and bad but at the most, but at the most And if I deserved the rope, I would have caught it all But here is therefore perfectly comfortable to go back to this year 1946 Where I was already saying at the theater of Dizern Well, it starts well the fourth Ah, it's nice at this time, you shouldn't just grow up Of course the third republic didn't start better in 1870 But it didn't stop to end even worse in 1940 Personally, I thought it wouldn't be all alone, but I didn't expect it to be It's all the same, rare to see so much nullity in the service of such a stupid idea For what is Cretan thumb and the other one I put a little more neck There is no Al Splin It seems that we are a turning point of history It is no longer a turning point, it is a labyrinth which they lost the key, by the way As Mr. Edouard and Rio say, former political déborder No, there is not something that doesn't have anything that goes Oh of course, with good will, it could be solved If each French was happy patrioticly, food relations were allowed by the government After three months, the population has decreased by half, we feel relieved Ah, rediscovering our sleeves, hardening the arms And that's it, work, take the money And it's a failure that you say Mr. Leand Blum, by the way, went to America to make the quest If I have good memories, the Rothschilds have bought the canal of Suez for the British crown If Leon could bring us Panama, it would be a way It seems that the Peace Conference will take place in Paris Yes, the exhibition of 37 did not have enough and we completely reconsidered And it is at this moment that the municipal council chose to close the closed houses They create the competition of the lawyers Ah, well, Mrs. Marcheter Richard, always at the service of France and passed instructions to the MERS, it is not in advance but surely at the old age I have the chance to say it, we are getting old ones The SDN, the Society of Nations, who made many generations die while waiting to assassinate the last one, by the way Coucou, the reveal, it's called the ONU Universal Negative Organization And we are entertaining people of my profession Oh, Mr. Paul Boncourt, Mrs. Mujave Tabouille, but yes, but yes Definitely, the ridicule, don't kill in France Without that, there would be no world left Note that sometimes we have the impression that we can't go lower And yet, as long as we don't go back, it's that we haven't touched the bottom Ah, we are so light, that's the miracle At each coup, bang, a coup of talent And hop, we will get it out Like Chante Saint-Granier, who fortunately came too In the middle of the form, not changed, always so causing And then they are not proud We overdo, fructuate, you are a piece of shit It's the new motto of the country It seems that we are going to make new, maybe not reasonable, but new And bang, we are stuck, Leo Blum Blum, Blum, maybe, it's the messie In France, we are used to taking messies for long term Immediately, we have put the stress level Ah, we will have to send the workers, stop the dashboard, delete three cars per minister And prevent the generos, that now the fast inspections will be offered Travel paid in third class with Costco In short, we must take unpopular measures And for this kind of work, there was only one, it was a man called Pierre Laval They shot him, suddenly, there was no one But we are still in full renaissance Well, a little more, the middle of the Nazism A new wave, a new wave, and we start again Oh, I know that all regimes have their disadvantages The king had a buffon, the republic has several The damage is what they want in the government When we saw Mr. Torres, the beautiful Maurice, the beautiful Maurice One of our best shots, by the way She is the famous soldier's tomb Still, it was double the use Because the famous soldier is him I noticed that I do not reproach him for being part of it, but rather for being included It is true that we called him, I wonder what could have done that Finally, we have a constitution, that's it You know, the one we voted three times, the first time no, the second yes, the third no Finally, we had no more Ah, but a very beautiful constitution, with the blessing of Jacques Duclos The little mitron who abandoned the laundry for the rising room The imprimatur of Karl Marx and the good to draw from the Emperor Schumann's dream The Marx-Brosers, what? Without forgetting, by the way, the exe act of Mr. Vincent Oriol Our new president, because we are done with the provisional We are there in the definitive, there is no hope No, no, Mr. Vincent Oriol may be more banal But then, the accent is cordial He has already gone to visit the empire with all his family A perial trip, you know We can be very faithful to what we need The metropolis rises quickly He said like that, Mr. Oriol, to the citizens of the Umband Yitzhar Yitzhad The cabbages and the bandos, they may not have been very well understood But they were very happy And then they made a lot of money, very appreciated We must say that there they are not grateful for the political speeches So they think it's true, they thank you gently, naturally Of course, here we are much too used to it, it makes a lot less We read it so much, and we read it in the newspapers Well, when it seems, because it was the strike And all that, just when we were going to train a new minister Ah, well, you have to change from time to time To be honest, we don't move to the port this time We play in the hidden cache And after you, in general, we take time from the side of Gaulle The Colombian and the two deputies To see if sometimes the greatest as a divider Would not have become the smallest multiple friend Finally, it gives Bido Torres Guimolé or Torres Guimolé Bido Finally, Bido, well-economic, by the way, he doesn't make too much Because the majority continues to look for himself You would not have met this handsome majority sometimes Only the Malgache autonomists seem to form the pivot On which the future will support government The one who will surely govern Because up to here, we do experiments It reminds me of the courses of Chimmy at Lycée It always ended with a chocolate-brin Despite the low volume, the 5% psychological shop It didn't last long The social re-vendication is full Here are the croc-morts, complaining about a price of income Of course, the people too, but seeing the abundance of materials As they say in the daily life And the ministries continue to be caged The ministers too, whether it be the one or the other Did you notice that to drive a bus, you need a permit to drive? But for the state's chariot No one, no matter where, no matter when Well, we sell the paris de la Trin, it's in Morasse, by the jades of the 43 who in Milan fire the France There will also be the 4 republics who in less than 100 years will have been killed It will not be wrong that we are purated Oh, there were purations in thought So, to force to remove the heads, well, there are no more than the feet While we have 32 ministers, it's a position for each Mr. Marius Mouté, the colonel's responsible, was in Indochina Very well, of course, there was a rocket of honor He did not insist, he went back very quickly, a little bit angry I left to say that to designate the minister of the colonies Right before, we will proceed so Having gathered the condemned, the president of the council Will do Amsterdam, Gram, Piquepiquepique, Piviet Nam, Buemu, Pivietmine, Ocimine It's you who is calling Ah, it's the news from there, how did you get inspired? And it makes sweat As the colonel De Vavrin, the chief of the DGR Who is being treated as the reactionary room, necessarily In the resistance, if it's called Pascit, it can not be called Au Bervillier Like everyone else At that moment, the front varies from zero to infinity It is a matter of the committee of ascending to modify the front I said, if we had a front point square, why not the Rupioriol And we are in full scandal Since the scandal of the wine, where we tried to compromise this poor Mr. Gouin, the Felix Gouin, by the way, it's not a name, it's a sound of a trumpet We have made great progress Ah, there are for all tastes You come out to me as a colonel, I answer you as a general I stop you as a father of Jesus, I book you as a rabbi I rectify you as a rector, I drop you on the ground I have a scratch, I have 10, 20, I have a minister compromised I have a whole ministry, I have a whole party, and I have all the parties This line of the Gouin, the scratchers, being passed on by the prevaricators, the false managers, the solders, the bought, the combiners, and the combiners The panic au crabe, the acid to the butter, it grows, it shrinks, it is torn, it is good And they call that the dirigism Mr. Ramadier, he told me, we don't understand anything And Mr. Nathan added, it's a lie If it is true that the roses grow on the smoke, here, France will be a rosary The military are in civil, the capors are colonel, the officers are directors, the patissiers are councilors of the republic The gaviers are in the essoutes, the essoutiers in the unions France Sunday, I speak on Tuesday, Saturday, Thursday morning Marcel Paul is in the cheese, and no one is in his place It is to say, if the cows are well kept To arrange everything, the deputies are in The last legislature is sold by a number of importers, jeep, coups de pied, and even a duel At the pistol, without results, by the way He speaks well, but he is not And then, why at the pistol, at the launch of the mayor, we would have understood No, well, outside of these funny fun, we always wait for the results of the investigation commission Parliamentary on the cause of our misfortunes since 1933 Oh, well, calm down, there will no more results Mr. Paul Reineau has just made a huge book that bears the truth This truth is a sight of a delicate cynicism And then, the truth of Mr. Paul Reineau, it does not make much of a truth What do you want? The fourth republic is in the hazy It is the crisis of growth There are many people who say, we are in the middle of it, how are we going to get out? But why do we have to get out? We are not bad like that The whole thing must not be vague Of course, the taxes are heavy, I am not against taxes Only above a certain number, we should have the right to the port of the Sable And the cops will salute you in the street, it would be something to study What do you want? In fourth, it is the direct price We must take the money where it is, in the leisure places, or the great cost of the 5,000 bills Of our dear mayor Mr. Robert Schumann, the one that the communists call the captain of the March glass Because they do not know where he was in 14 But we know where the respected mutin was In 1917, in the 40s, it was a means Mr. Robert Schumann, our great desargentiers, gave us a little bit of a full, all in a little way Oh, the full of the original two With mayor, it is the gang of the fractions before Instead of increasing taxes, it will make the tax charges more expensive Feel the nuance Oh, you will feel it We are in Colmatt before going out on imposition prepared in advance Fortunately, the reconstruction is working, it is not a giant The place of the concorde, the chalet of necessities demolished by the liberation Is still in ruin, 80% But there is a reason, as it is in front of the American embassy, we hope the epitwins But for the real reconstruction, it is going very well They miss the materials, the work and the authorizations But we have the location Oh, what a color! We can not do everything at the same time Mr. Pierre de Gaulle, the brother of Charles, who is not the mayor We lose ourselves in his great families The old cry of alarm We have not enough children In 20 years, France will be an old country Well, only if we make a lot of children In 10 years, France will be a baby country We will be well advanced There are so many injuries this year, they were forced to put it in the bread And, as the exceptional harvest of raisins, the wine has dropped from 2 degrees What has dropped above all, it is the content of the green in the coffees Well, another war, and we drink the red wine on green plates Finally, after the last election in Canthon, everyone is very happy What we lost, we won the votes What we lost, we won the votes, everyone won the votes Bravo! Apart from that, nothing has changed in the guignol of the fourth The third force, sorry, force, continue And Charles waits André Malraux, at the six RPF, has decided to gather He has declared France a leader that she can look without having a glass It will not be easy to find It is said that it is a friendly war for Mr Vincent Horiol Who personally does not make me laugh at all Mr Paul Reno has made a strong return The road of the Flair is open He seems to be a carpenter, Mr Paul Reno It is the man who makes pst And now, the contribuable will no longer be a revolt but a collaborator It will allow to shoot more easily We are once again in full redress All we can fear, in these cases of too much redress We break out the joke behind With Mr Cueil and Petsch, we are calm We are ready for Dr Cueil, besides the parody of the word Clemenceau If I can, it's him who pst, shabou It may be thanks to that, besides that the emperor has succeeded We have not even had the time to see the money come back The real machine has inspired the fountains Oh, for a long time, we have been making the budget We are making it, but with what elegance? Mr Cognot, a predestined name, signed in humanity No, France is not a finite country It is undoubtedly why they want to make it Because during this time, the little father Joseph, the real Pazzoinovici No, no, the Bessarabian Who condemned him to irony at the national dignity Is that to tell you what it must have hit? No, the real Joseph Stalin, the little pernietniet Is in the process of digesting China Ah, it is true that in front of Canton, the yellow troops, finally red Are commanded by an old worker of his Renault France is present everywhere When Sancai-Chek will become the Maréchal Pékin And that Mao Tse-Tung will have provisionaly the illusion of unifying China The Anglans will not be the last to try to hurt him Their marches say, ah, they are well alive They thought that four years of working government They put the lowest Anglans, which Napoleon would never have dreamed of What a revenge! Here, are we getting stuck by the iron curtain Where the name of the little father, the son of the people, the Saint-Esprit of the Maghazics And one morning we wake up, re-dressed by the red-haired red-haired The Cossacks have two stages of border But everything is ready to receive them The sixth column is in place The Morné procurator, whose name alone is a matter of trust Because finally, it was called Morné, and still there, this age And after a long time, under the threat, it does not count that he re-dressed like that So we know who we will judge, and it's reassuring There is hope, still Oh, the Benelux is with us, Benelux is making it aspirator We signed the Bipartite pact, so we know we have two, it supports Well, at least as long as the minister is gathered, if I may say In which we count Madame Poinsau-Chapuilly and Monsieur Coupé-Luisifolo Sorry, Coupé-Luisifolo, in the Ravitarie, he was extraordinary In the Olympic Games, we were the only country in the Vagonde Vienne That wanted to arrive in Paris, in Triomphe And then there is Monsieur Claudius Petit, in the reconstruction The name is a little pretentious, but the name clearly indicates the state of the work So, little by little, little by little, little by little Ah, but then we have Zoe, the atomic pile, the others are doing the bomb, we are taking the pile Monsieur Joliot, who is only cured by alliance To send a telegram to Monsieur Vincent Horiol, had the good day of Zoe Tovarris, this Joliot Curie After having declared that Monsieur Horiol is a sub-signal It is true that in Rome, he does not sub-sign much Even in the state in which we are To answer, live Zoe, I am proud of my pile, signed by Vincent And we voted for the budget, which proves that everything is possible Here is the Western government of Berlin, which was born The Chancellor of the Adenauer, we do not want to take it for a head of a bridge It is curious to note that when the Germans occupied France The brand was at 20 francs If we start to wonder if sometimes it would not be too much of a 20-hour And say that all this would not have happened If Karl Marx had written about the city of Wauldwil Well, it is true that we have not known either the happy, far-fetched of Gary Davis, the citizen of the world, who was a Swedish Please, it is true that we are received anywhere Since Schimin was well-being And the ministerial saraband continues We even had a concentrated cabinet Not to be confused with a concentrated cabinet There was only 13 ministers and Bidou was not in the mood He has declared that the storm is breaking the leaves There is still the throne, he will make the quest In reality, if ministers change, ministers do not often change A real man is in this mess, the old man's box is the fireball Ramadiyeh Marie Schumann, Schumann Marie Ramadiyeh If Ramadiyeh is Schumann, then Schumann is Ramadiyeh It is even Mr. Robert Schumann who often passes He is completely past When it comes to the bill, it is severe On the management of our finances, having deposited his bill The bill is in gold and on the session hall A writer at the door and that's all The bill is in gold, he sleeps in the back, not in his muskets And say, and say, that there are people who are asking If we go one day in the moon, but we go The Medical Academy has just declared that the Parisians drink a repugnant but not toxic Well, it is the conclusion of the second scandal of the 20th If you follow, besides, the one of the Olympics, of Radio Endor, or of the good of Arras The 3D of Order of the Heart and of History Of History in 12, it will be the first time that we will see a deputy admit something Oh, we have the choice! There is almost as much scandal as military that writes books To show, and primarily, how they should have won all their battles There are so many that I read a little announcement in the official journal And your major, General Search, is able to command in front of the enemy without publishing a memory Ah, all these negative conclusions will end up taking us away from prestige And yet, at the Danube conference, our delegates, the guides in the same country Have brought a success of Steam Danube is closed to our boats, but no Soviet cruiser is authorized on the lake of the Boulogne Ah, but we are still there, maybe we don't have many boats But the National Navy is still on the ground Nothing that takes more than 20 boats to Paris And planes, planes, we have at least one Since it is on him that the beautiful girl of a very well-known republican personality has taken a pilot But it's even a Margoulais case No, it doesn't matter, the old man is at the social assurance Just this afternoon, I read a book by Mr. George Aquin, very interesting, on the Champs-Élysées In 1860, instead of the Grand Palais, there was a circus In which the main clown was called Horiol The circus disappeared It was part of the Vaudville, it was a story of Paris That was recorded during the 1950s With Philippe Olive, you find that it really changed in 1992 Except the name of the characters, Vincent Horiol, all that is French history But in what concerns the people who are in the moon, politicians and all that The politics of today's day, well, it hasn't really changed And I think this record had all its ups and downs today After the votes you made this weekend And we'll go back to Europe, would you have voted yes or no if you were French?
