No barreiro Margem-Sol do Tajo termina logo à tarde o Congresso da Juventude Comunista. O primeiro encontro entre Clinton e Alxin em Vancouver causou boa impressão tanto ao presidente norte-americano como ao da Rússia. O porta-voz da Casa Branca considerou mesmo um bom começo. E repetiu que os Estados Unidos estão confiantes que a Simeira seja bastante produtiva até porque Clinton, Alxandre Alucas Coelho, não esconde de ninguém a vontade que tem em ajudar Alxin. O presidente americano acredita que só apoiando Alxin vão continuar as reformas. É isso que ele tem explicado aos americanos. Se a Rússia for democrática, então os Estados Unidos não têm que estar dinheiro na defesa. Os americanos não estão muito convencidos. O próprio bufo de eles não está arreciado porque é que ainda há um de dar dinheiro aos russos. Seja como for, Clinton vem à Vancouver determinada a ajudar Alxin. Os Estados Unidos querem mesmo ajudar a Rússia. O presidente Clinton já disse que só essa ajuda pode ajudar a salvar a democracia na antiga União Soviética. No partido socialista francês já começaram a rolar cabeças. Laurent Fabius, o primeiro secretário, foi afastado da liderança do PS pelo Comitê Diretivo. E o que está a acontecer no PSF, Daniel Ribeiro, acaba por não surpreender ninguém. O que está a acontecer neste momento no PSF é histórico. Rob Carr tomou hoje conta do PSF e o presidente Mitterrand deixou de poder contar com o partido que fundou. O descalabro e leitoral nas legislativas está na origem de tudo isto. Algunos dirigentes históricos mostram-se aliás bastante desorientado. Daniel Ribeiro, em Paris, no PSF as mudanças a histão. Laurent Fabius saiu, Michel Rocares subiu. Tragede-a numa mina de carvão, no nord-est de China, há pelo menos 22 mortos. Não se sabe ainda o porquê da explosão e nem quantas pessoas estavam no interior da mina quando ela aconteceu.

Vamos recordar aqui um trecho de Paulo Alexandre durante muitos anos considerado praticamente o hino da imigração ao verde vinho. Ainda muito cedo, mas a bom recordar aqui este bonito trecho de Paulo Alexandre. Ouvimos aqui o verde vinho com Paulo Alexandre, tambem queremos deixá-lo com sorriso nos lábios neste domingo de manhã, ouvindo já de imediato as pedinhas e torradinhas dos nossos amigos para o dientes de Lisboa. No ar, através da antena portuguesa e com destino a Losana, Suíça, vai aterrar o avião Ritrit da compania PL para o dientes de Lisboa. Senhores ouvintes, aperta-os cintos que algo se fa na Portugal. Obrigada e hoje alas da dia seja uma alegria. O riso é preciso. Ah, mas ele diz que vai continuar a tomar medidas. A tomar medidas? Pois é, ele faz um fato novo todas as semanas. Ah, pessoal, tudo na maior? Ah, por acaso lá em casa nós estamos todos na maior, porque temos 4 televisões com ecras diferentes tamanhos e enquanto uns estão a ver o futebol na maior, também há que estas já haver as novelas, nas mais pequenas. É isso aí, sinceramente o tamanho pouco interessa. Ah, eu também acho isso por acaso. Às vezes quando menos se espera é de um pequenime que vem a maior probeza. À vez disso, o caso do Roberto Carneiro, por exemplo, são as espiadinhas e torradinhas dos perudientes. Perudientes. Muito antes, se pensar na entrada de mulheres para as forças armadas, já que já tínhamos afinal uma mulher que era general, ninguém tinha dado por nada, porque são tantos dos generais e, em respeito, o bastão ou, por menos, o pingalim. Proverbios antigos, a inversão atualizada. Acabá-lo dado, não se olham dente. Para ser com um carro premiado, não importa as figuras que faz a gente. A menina e ao borrar, se põe Deus a mão por baixo. Uma criança ou um bêbado acaba onde sempre por sopar para um balão. Chega-te aos bons terais um deles. Chega-te aos maus e serás pior do que eles. Se mudas tanto de partido e do sim fizesse-te não, qualquer dia olhas para o espanho e veja lá um camaleão. Viva alegria! Viva! Proibem-nos do Carnaval põem tudo muito mais caro. Acontece, em Portugal, um país que é mesmo raro. Do remédio, ao transporte, tudo tem um grosso aumento. O salário que é de morte sobe só uns 6%. Dê-nos mais televisão para que a gente se console. E o futebre para um milhão vem para o nosso futebol. O L'Olásis de Preça foi, pois era apenas valela para meter-me dar um boi. Não me deram nem morcella. Viva alegria! Viva! Viva! Amor e promenão, aqui vão mais algumas divertidas piadinhas a granel. Afinal, o doutor Baris Suá já não parece ser tão la como dizia. Porque é que dizia isso? Porque lá vias convidou para jantar o Espírito Santo. O dirigente do Partido Socialista mostrou-se favorável a venda livre de todas as drogas. Drogas leves? Leves pesadas e semi-pesadas. Tá bonito, sim senhor. Qualquer dia já estou a ver-nos supermercados, o AX, em promoção para quem comprar heroína. As mulheres são incapazes de guardar um segredo. Tá desenganado, homem. Eu também pensava assim. E o que é que eu vou mudar de ideia e pensar que, a finala, as mulheres sabem guardar segredo. Quando perguntei a idade, algumas delas? Há dias, o doutor Antonio Guterres disse que o centro cultural de Belém não passava de um grande parque de estacionamento de automóveis. Ah, a ideia da ver confusão. Sendo aquilo um palácio de cultura, certamente, estava a se referir a autos dos ilvisantes. Há pelo jantar, oferecido pelo doutor Mário Soares, só existiram pessoas ligadas à autofinança. Banqueiros, grandes empresários... Não digas mais! Em vez de arroz de miúdos devem ter servido arroz de graúdos. Mária, simplesmente, Maria. Uma crónica de sandália de correia. Mária, simplesmente, uma crónica de sandália de correia. Para começar pelo princípio falo de uma Maria que foi a primeira embora lhe chamasse em piedosa, certamente porque, muitas vezes, apia. Dona Maria Primeira começou por casar com um tio, depois de mitiu o Marquejo de Pombal e para provar que era mesmo maluca de todo, foi morrer longe. Isto é ao Brasil. E foi precisamente no Brasil que nasceu a Maria que foi a segunda, demonstrando que daquelas paraagens também podem vir outras coisas além de desempregados dentistas e desgraças em forma de telenovela. Pois, adona Maria Segunda talvez por não haver televisão naquela altura entretevesse a fazer filhos formando uma equipa de 11 elementos esterando ao dar a luz o décimo primeiro talvez por não ter dado a alvalade. Continuaremos numa próxima emissão porque começarem a mais Marias cá na terra. O diciário desinformativo e bastante mentiroso. O microfone, o porte-voz da redação, do ditado e da cópia, Arturo Aldra Berrân. A construção do alquéva irá iniciar-se logo que comece embora os alentes-janos só acreditem quando realmente for. Segundo consta o travesti Bel Dominique apresentou-se na TVI apenas porque ninguém percebeu que ele é ela. Manuel Monteiro foi levar um programa ao presidente da República o qual, como se sabe, nunca tem falta de programa. Alterado, o quadro do hospital de Angra do Iruísmo, trocando a natureza morta por uma paisagem com o forme de crédito original publicado no Diário da República. Alberto João Jardim deslocou-se à África do Sul embora se desminta que tivesse sido contratado para tocar tambor. A mulher da Collor de Meller foi apreciada por desveu de fones públicos, o que vai provar que eles são casados em regime de comunhão de Máulias. O inautel vai investir um milhão de contos nos assortos, não se sabendo ainda se é em dinheiro ou em falta da transversa do fute para a região autónoma. Senhoras e senhores, aproxima-se, ao final, destas piadinhas e torradinhas nos perodiante. Olha, destas a sentir as cidadas da primavera nos das. Calque, esta comissão é falta de banho por causa da seca. Pó disposição ao tenismo muita alegria de viver porque o reto é preciso. Beijinhos, beijocas e não se metam na vida das figuras públicas que é para não ter mais desilusões. Topam? Deslindado o caso da vírgula. Após horas de interrogatório e tortura a jornalista confessou finalmente o seu erro de pontuação. Não era vírgula, mas irreticências. Ainda não tem valdria. Viva! Viva! Viva! Viva! Acabamos de apresentar as piadinhas e torradinhas dos perdiantes do Lisboa que vão voltar com novos sketches já na próxima semana. Para já, a música de Anna e Luís Vicente tira a mãozinha. Tira a mãozinha as vozes com um gazal simpático e, às vezes, ataquia a animar as noites. Um pouco frias da comunidade portuguesa através dos seus espetáculos junto das associações. Let's make a call to Lisboa to have the latest information of the Lusso Agency. Good morning, the Lusso Agency about the main events of the world. The presidents of the United States and of Russia, Belclin, and Altin, respectively, were in good mood during the first meeting of the summit held yesterday in Vancouver. The first meeting was also considered a good start by the White House's voice George Stephanopoulos. The second and last day of the summit has played out. Clinton and Altin have predicted the meeting at 10.40 in Lisboa after a press conference between the 13 and 30 local 23 and 30 in Lisboa making the balance of the summit. The government, in a way, considers the US political in the Middle East and appealed to the US president to review this policy. There are many contradictions in the US policy about the peace process in the Middle East. In many cases, this policy is not logical or objective. According to a paper about the Damascus government, the policy followed by the US government favours Israel and the countries in which the peace process began at the beginning of the 7 months in Madrid. President Ejipzio Osnimo Barak arrived yesterday in Washington and started an official visit during which he had contact with his American-American almove Bill Clinton. Clinton is currently in Vancouver where the Russian president Boris Altin receives the White House on Tuesday. The visit of Mubarak to the United States occurs when the entire terrorist group seriously assaults Egypt. The ministers of foreign affairs and other countries of the Cooperation Council of the Gulf of Pesce are gathered today to ensure security in that region. The ministers will analyze the continuous violations of the Qatiana border by Iraq, which puts the security and stability in that region, said Secretary-General of the Organization Fahem el-Kazemi. The Prime Minister Ejipzio said yesterday in Parliament that the delivery of Mamoud Aboualim to the FBI was possible due to the fact that the brain was attempted against the New York World Trade Center North American nationality. Lima has a North American passport and its delivery to the FBI cannot be considered a violation of the sovereignty of Egypt. The chief of diplomacy referred to it. Meanwhile, the Egyptian deputies criticized the government of Cairo for delivering Lima to the United States. Why does the president of the Republic visit the United States? It's a good thing, isn't it? The session will be held in the municipal chamber for the 10.30 following the delivery of keys from the social housing bar with the name of the recent president of the capital of April, Salgueiro Meia. The ceremony will be held with the presence of the military and former companions named Vasco Lorenzo. In addition to short locations to the Biblioteca Museum, Marisóares will visit the headquarters of the Keroz Foundation in Tormos, the scenario of the Keroz and the city of the Serras. These and other news, with the most prominent in the video, are of light. Now, also with the anonymous text through the phone 067-196 or only 1-96. The rhythm of the cigar with the whistle and the chorus in a song that gives the name, my passion cigar, before presenting the sport rubric about the shots and the point of the foot. The rhythm is already there. It's good, it's good. It's your information of the sport. Here treated are the shots and the point of the foot. Football, qualification, for the European selection of hope in the night, not qualification for the World Cup, the selection made what it can more in a brigade several changes of sports, report also infected with the Moura de Sportos Club when visiting this club here in Switzerland. All this will be developed within a few moments, we hope well with a speed that already used our hearing with Antoni Picard. Very good day. Good day, we are in Portugal and we spend this first Sunday of April of 1993 with that good expression for more information about the sport and the fact that from the radio studio it was changed to 102.8 for all, good day, good tune votes. Let's start by what was the event this week with two games that were played by the A and B in Iverdon and in Berna, the development with Antoni Picard. A fact in Iverdon stadium, with 3,000 spectators, Switzerland, Portugal, a young team using it at night, in the past Tuesday and a vintage arbitrage from Bulgaria that did not help the Portuguese football media. At the end of the game, the enemies were caught in the central bank where the police interviewed and detained a compatriot of ours accused of having attacked the referee with a bottle of wine, scenes that should be avoided but such did not happen in Iverdon on Tuesday. On the next day in Berna, for the World Cup and with the presence of 31,000 spectators, new tie, Switzerland, Portugal, a great responsibility game for the formation of Carlos Queiroz who took in his luggage a logical and logical tie. It would be Switzerland to mark the first midfield of the well-known Stefano Chapizá having the seed equal to the game until his crossing of the Bel Xavier. With this result of a group of work, the selection of all of us accomplished his mission, was cheerful, competent and effective. In terms of classification, the Tourmalouse takes the fourth place with four points while the formation is the leading team with eight points. The next national team game is on April 28 against its Scottish general a game that the Portuguese team will have to win to continue on the right path. This is to qualify for the World Cup of 1994 in the United States. Both in Iverdon and in Berna, the Portuguese team had a chance and picked up some words from the coach and the president of the Portuguese football team. We started with José Alberto Costa and asked that the team really had the chance in Iverdon in the night. That was the answer of this young coach. First of all, I want to ask the Portuguese team not to play better. But to be responsible is exclusively the Swiss Federation for the fact that this happened. Because those who are in the field in these conditions with this field, with this arbitration, it is impossible to do better. So we are satisfied with what we produced. As I mentioned we cannot play better. The game technically was not anything special, on the contrary, it was quite poor, but it was worth the determination, it was worth the unity in the field so that we could not win and we tried and fought for it to have at least been able to tie. José Alberto Costa, the Portuguese team said at night and Arviadraja did not help either. Well, that was to join all the tribulations that existed, all the conditions of the field that presented us. We still had this difficulty we, the game that we played against everything and against everyone. Despite that, we were not able to defeat them. We are satisfied with that. The Portuguese team continues to qualify. Well, everything is open, we will continue game after game, try better results and better exhibitions. José Alberto, this is a word for immigration that is here tonight. It is always nice to see us having the Portuguese. It is always nice to see the way the Portuguese live here, the problems there and support here the selection there. Congratulations to you and to the finalists. Thank you and congratulations to everyone. Thank you. When we, as a professor, Carlos Queiroz, coach of the Portuguese national team, a tie that is in Bern, satisfied? Well, depending on the circumstances it was good, but I think there was a little taste that we could have gone a little further. But, ready, we scored and that was important. Carlos Queiroz, our team arrived here a little bit disappointed. What is your opinion? We arrived here without eight players of which six to seven could be titles. But I think the players were here at the time, they played very well, they defended very well, they attacked very well, I think it was very beautiful. Satisfied with the presence of the Portuguese national team? Yes, a great thanks to everyone. Thank you. When I am at the Vondorf in Bern, president of the Portuguese football definition, Victor Vázquez, how did you see this match between Switzerland and Portugal? The first place allows me, a very big thanks to all the Portuguese, to the two of our team, I was extremely encouraged and I send a big hug to all the Portuguese. In the second place, answering your question, I think it was a well-discoveredarea game, we surprised as a team young Switzerland. The game was, I think it was a good game, and here is the future of the Portuguese football, with this team, for a few years I think we can see the future of the Portuguese football. President, with this result, despite this tie, we still have all the hypotheses we know in the United States. Obviously, we have all the hypotheses in this moment with Switzerland, with Italy and with Scotland itself, everything is open, so we can win the games at home that we lack, and score more points out. What was the value above the selection today? President, you cannot highlight the values, this is good for the gentlemen who criticize the games. The fundamental was that the whole team was beaten with a lot of anger, we had the anxiety of the forced substitution of the summit, the polition, I think it took seven or eight points on the leg, but all the players were beaten with a lot of anger, they were wearing a shirt, which is a great honor for the president of the federation. Thank you for these words in Portuguese Thank you, thank you, thank you Thank you. The report was recorded Thursday at night in Berna by Antonio Pican. Exactly, Thursday and also on Tuesday in Iverdong. Great, let's go. I just want to quickly, after the national selection work, which today begins the national championship of the Paramedi de Visão, with the rejection of the Vigésimo 6th Jornalanda, and the football matches are the following, passes of Ferreira and the Estoril, in Vidal Pinheiro Salgueiros Marítimo, Fomoriquão Beiramar, in the first of May, Sporting Braga Vitorio de Guimarães, in Alvalá Sporting Boa Vista, Sporting Espintes Portifixávis, in the stadium Ida Luz Bemficas, Gil Vicente, the game Ferença, Porto's football was given to May, more precisely for the 19th day. We also remember our listeners, who in the next Wednesday, another Wednesday of European competitions and Porto's football is going to be the PSV in Dovente Parmaes, a league day of champions. To learn about the calendar, since Porto's football has no possibility of... Nothing, absolutely nothing. Of course. Let's go through the different sports modalities and as we are talking about different sports modalities, I hope you will talk about Albertina Dias who was champion of Cross, of World Athletics and I say this because Albertina Dias is going to be here live with us on April 24th where we are going to make a very special broadcast on April 24th Saturday afternoon of 1 plus 2 and a half, we are going to do a very special broadcast because we are going to meet live here in this same studio for our listeners Albertina Dias, World Cross champion and... a wonderful fact, a wonderful fact that we are going to meet here tonight in Patino Arto Morje, will be here live with our listeners through these same microphones of Radio Acilu, Mark who already met for the broadcast on April 24th, will be a very special broadcast with music and sport. Exactly, that's how it is in Portuguese. Let's go then to these various modalities and we can start. Let's start with the volleyball national of the first division, there is news that so many sportsmen are wHaïti ng to see if the rival is well in 3-1 in the Alvalado ship and made the championship party, guaranteeing the national title of volleyball with four days of precedence. Starting from the strong opposition and some minor nervousness to the character of the matches, the goalkeepers, the triumph, also the maintenance of invincibility. Automobilism, the World Cup Ayrton Senna, achieved an impossible to see his great prize in Brazil, the Inter Lagos. The French Alan Prost confirmed his great favoritism, dominated from the beginning but failed roundly when it began to rain, he ended up staying out of the race. Senna took advantage of the rival's discuit and won the 37th victory of his career. And also took the command of the pilot's world championship even though his participation in the remaining tests is still a little cognitive. And in athletics to the Breton days, he won the title of World Cup of the Big League, a victory that never suffered against each athlete of the Maradona, he never stopped from the beginning, which he knew how to observe what was always around him, with the eyes well opened to those who could build his great dream, the World Cup, to the Breton days, an optimistic athlete already thinking about this place. Football of the Portuguese league here in the region, the 4th league championships, the sports union Terra Santa Zé, Lúcia and Andglând 2, the Portuguese center of the Molds and 4, the football club Deau Bono 3, this particular activity of the Portuguese, plays today starting from 10 o'clock, a game in which the Portuguese center of Molds is located at the Apple's Balances football club and the game will start, as he said, at 10 o'clock. Football Club Villeneuve 1, at the Rennanche 2 Football Club Atlantique de Vévé 4, the footwork of 2 and in the different 5th league championships, the association of the 4th league of the football club Deau A0 and the Spanish de Montre 0, the Portuguese union Deau Zana 3 and also today the sports center of the QI plays in front of the Xavanes and Pné a game to play starting from 10 o'clock in the morning. Ok, Patins, it was with the positive that the Molds Football Club was asked from Switzerland, where they played last weekend a international tournament of this modality. The Molds finished in the second place in the final against the experienced team of the Montreux Ok Club, for a conclusion of 13-3. We accompanied this team in an extraordinary environment before we started the report. I just wanted to say that these young players were much more public, especially in the part of the Molds. Let's go to the report made in the Pavilion de la Disportive of the PRE. We were with the public, we were with the players, we were with the members of the team, we were with the coaches, we were with so many people. Let's go to the report. Francis Fonseca, natural demoral, as is normal, but besides being the most important in this, is to be at a Portuguese party, because the Portuguese parties are not just singing, dancing, the sport is a Portuguese party really. It is a convivial that serves, besides our practitioners, to come with the immigrants, and the immigrants to see our athletes. And we, as we resided unfortunately outside of our country, we were not within the team. I was very happy because I did not expect even the potential of them to be so strong. Everyone did their best for that and will thank the Portuguese antenna for the support of us always, all of us Portuguese. I am very proud. What did you like more in this team, the Mora, the team of Tinsa and Mora, is it well-known or not? Yes, I am very proud of the team that I came with. Yes, yes, it is the first time, because I did not know the team, the values ​​that we had, but I was happy because it was a very good participation, and we were very happy to come here, although we did not win, but we were very satisfied. It was an interest in the sports value and the interest to participate, because we were very happy and it was it was a pity, we did not win, but we won. It is the first time, but I liked it a lot, although I did not see any sports, but I was happy and I liked it present. As young people, although I am 33 years old, I always consider myself young. In the sports room of the PRE, another female voice, what is your name? Madame Gonçalves. Madame Gonçalves, this is also an impression that the French, already is shown with Portuguese, the Mrs. here in Switzerland is the first time, but in Portugal, yes, it is Mora, already seen. What was the impression that this young team, Morenze, left the good here, I really liked to see the team, I think it played very well, right? The last one. Here is another gentleman who is very old, I know she wants to speak for the Portuguese microphone, very good afternoon, what is your name? Lina Fonseca. I ask the same question, is it the first time you saw Mora sports that she played in the KBT? Yes, I liked it very much, I don't know, to come here to give strength to a Morenze team, right? If we had a good presence in this tournament, I think the second place is already very good, given that we had many games in two days, we had four games. Our team, in terms of physical, is not prepared for this situation, we train basically two times a week, it is not possible, more hours to train, it is possible to leave a message, but this second place will be dedicated to all the Portuguese who helped us and who supported us in these games we did here in the Monterey de Monterey. Thank you. Yes, it is the first time that I am present and I go with the heart, how to say a little in great so much I am very satisfied, it is a great joy that I am here with the people of my land and not only if you play with me, I am here I am natural, I live and we are also, therefore we have a national level in arbitrage there and if you play with me, you play with all the boxes and therefore I am very satisfied that my land has obtained a great second place has beaten the teams of Germany, Italy and out there I am very satisfied, I am here very with a great great joy and without any doubt, this team is the first time that I play a tournament of this nature was very positive, to have in what is referred to the organization is also very welcome, the Morad Sposk really comes out here very satisfied I want in the sports field, I want in the convivial that I got over these two days with other teams not only in Switzerland, but also in Italy, the German team even though it is the Fissiou canton and with the team of Montreux it was a good game, this was the last one that was played, it was a shame that this tournament ended because it was the two teams that improved what they practiced, it was the two teams that were most evident in terms of results and it was a shame the result was so unbalanced between our team and the team of Montreux and it was a very decisive game for this tournament this was my friends, the report is made by the entire Portuguese, last weekend in the PBR sports team and as I said, besides some spectators we heard the words of the players also from the Federal referee Lucien Reis and finally the words of the coach of Morad Sports Club João Catrapona, since here I thank all those who participated in this tournament, who in one way or another helped you, thank you very much I thank you all for the votes for the rest of the program and for the rest of the program and until next week on the Rádio Açíduo's Sunday from Lausanne, a big hug to

the office in street near Marche number 3 in Lausanne Pedro Villar sang here maybe a song written by Carlos Peão Music Music Music Music Good afternoon, friends we are on Sunday of Ramos the first day of the week on these big days, I confess that I have a certain difficulty in this Dominican talk and this, because since the beginning I have been proposed and I strive to to fulfill, to respect the ideas of each one I do not use this radio to do proselytism, to pull whoever it is, for the religion that everyone knows is mine I think, however, on the other hand that most of it would not forgive me if I did not say an amazing word to the day that we are and the week that will begin we call it, in Portugal at least the biggest week not that it has more days than the others but because in it Christians revive the greatest events and the greatest mysteries of faith that profess them begins the week with this Sunday of Ramos Christ received in triumph the people wanted to make him a king in the way of men extending their heads, palms acclaims, while he passes a multidimensional maneuverable that three or four more days later will be heard, crucify crucify we prefer that you release us a criminal it is the week of the greatest events of the greatest attractions of the greatest political managances of the stupidity of all radicalism and of the religious that lead to the absurdity of killing because of religion the week of the Jews who attract the political heralds afraid of losing the throne of the Jews who know that to make the great condemn innocent and stay in the ink washing their hands the week of the people that we are all and we all have a look at the words we speak that many times we stop to take away because we have the ability to take words of order and we stop to manipulate until we shout in one way or another crucify the week that will follow has, as a background the cross there is a song of the father very well known by there that says a young man was crucified for teaching us to live and I shout to my people of the screen that I believe in the cross for teaching us to live but he taught the people of the cross that he was the first to die but he taught what? to the great to the Caesar to the heralds, to the Pilates, to the politicians he taught that to rule is to serve and that to serve is to love is to respect what has no defense not wash your hands of what has the responsibility is to fight and suffer for justice to the religious of all times, to the now also to the sumo's of the priests he taught that above all the precepts is love he taught that the most important is the man and that a religion that puts anything any law, any law above man is a lie he taught all of us that is giving what is love is forgiving what is enlarged is dying that lives music this week was a real revolution in humanity without needing bombs without needing to kill and I wanted to tell you to amenize all this a veridic fact two or three days ago with a Portuguese friend who came from Portugal he had a few days in my house here comes another time two years ago he was in this mission to be interviewed by the cycle come because of an exhibition of inventions that every year is made in Geneva and where he ended up getting a goal d medal in this invention our Portuguese are generally good the problem is that they always end up being taken advantage of by others without respect for the copyright that in the end is a carola that is getting with some medals but that was not what I wanted to refer I wanted to tell you a veridic fact past with that my friend in a supermarket of mortars in one of these misunderstanding French with a hand-picked suitcase he was driving to a lady in a boutique and asked her to keep the suitcase while he was there at the supermarket she showed her a receipt and then he seemed to understand that he was talking about the possibility of a bomb for the reason that the lady had received a act any terrorism that could have a bomb in the suitcase trying to explain with some in French and others in Portuguese my friend opened the suitcase and showed it to the lady look my lady bring two bombs here and took out two small bags one with a third one another with a cross the lady disarmed took it right away in the suitcase and the cross once again was a bomb a good Sunday and a good holy week for everyone and a good trip for those who go to Portugal and a hug and a big thank you and also the inventor is the main hobby he has come here regularly to this exhibition hall to present his inventions he has won a lot of awards including three goal d medals three silver medals a pink mansion this pink mansion I am very proud of it because it was a pink mansion about the energy power that's it and medals the heart and medals of a rich French a heritage of the army the people of silence the general Mino Miguel when did the idea of starting to invent things come to mind I have the impression that the idea of inventing things we had right after the garden we need to know to face a side to the other we start to have ideas how to get out of it the fact of being born in Portugal and not born in a more industrialized country is an handicap for someone who tries to create who tries to invent something new I am proud of being born in Portugal I don't despair but when I look at the aspect of helping the industrial and economic sector with greater support that's true we have had a lot of sacrifices not only physical as a monetary and in the end the ideas we have here and I noticed that there was an individual copying the doubles for the break we saw ideas or salons and then technology that could be used by the Portuguese industrial is raised by foreigners and then Portuguese come to buy technology spending what they should spend with the Portuguese inventors but the support is very few and I know that there are many friends Mr. Padre Murias de Queiroz who has given the hospital here in Switzerland and secondly it seems that this year he didn't get any support to present his inventions at the Geneva Salon it's true even the support that I have received this year was not any the support I have received I have not stopped receiving that support that paternal support that affectionate support that has been given 20 talents that I have received from Mr. Padre Antonio Augusto Murias de Queiroz I have received and in 1980 I came here for the first time I came again in 1991 I came in 1993 and it was always a house with many or few resources always received me and my family I stay there I eat, I drink and they are made all the supplies all the maquettes and that's where I get that comfort that strength to live a little while ago he spoke in the cross and it's true I feel at home I feel at home I tell him, I tell him the success of the cross this is how you make me live it's the same cross the cross is how you make me live and I can say that this cross was given to me by Father Antonio Augusto Murias in 1970 let's recap a little I would like Mr. Viturino Moreira Fernandes I will not call him the first sergeant because I am seeing him more as a civil as a military recap a little I would like I would like to say that I have made many things but what are the objects or the inventions that feel more proud of all it's all the inventions each inventor wants I have things I have five children I have three children I have three children I have the same affection the same dedication there are some who live more to build there are others who live more to idealize the first one is the carbon-electronized churrasque with this churrasque I have two goal den silver medals I have a goal d medal I have a goal d medal I have awards awarded in Portugal I have a heart medal then I go to the double-double-double for clothes I have the goal d medal of the city of Salão Mundial Borchelas this year the silver medal and people ask why the silver medal was awarded and the silver medal was awarded I think it's fair that the judge was aware of that and I think it's fair that the prize was awarded as the silver medal was awarded in 1990 then I have the sports of the cuffs for the furniture it's not more than a stick where I received a goal d medal in 1991 then I have the disassembly vases for the plants disassembly vases the best to write because you have a small model you can make a description because it's on the radio and people are not seeing it the disassembly vases you can make the change because I also have plants at home and now it's spring this summer in spring but the normal the normal type is round open to the middle it's open to the middle there's no more than that without a bottom the bottom itself is the practice that then has a silicone salience where it will tighten the bottom and a key on one side and the other that will tighten the base therefore there is a recuperation of the base and it does not bring the soil and the plant there is a direct transplant a direct recovery therefore the ease of transplantation of a plant for another base this is the practical utility that everyone is guessing at least those who have plants what is the way that the middle needs to be able to industrialize to be able to manufacture this invention at this moment I am here with this invention I pay for myself because it could not have been chosen because the inventions that were supplied by the genie and by the net and this was not chosen I understood that I should come with it because it was of global interest and I thought that the patent the priority of the international patent registry was on November 21, 1993 if I were with him in September 1993 he would risk any person to copy and re-establish it internationally I came here I recognized with the medallion as it was I think that at this moment any any Portuguese company would save it and that would be a waste at least from 3700 contos in the molds for the factory in series 3700 contos will be the necessary amount to create the manufacturing structure the factory itself does not need to buy machines because it already has then it only launches in series and then invest worldwide this is what is necessary around 10,000 contos worldwide in the middle of all this and I talked about the millions of contos what is the inventor going to receive the inventor received received in this case it comes to be commercialized let's put it that way so it is commercialized it has a great success together with the public sold to the millions is this a percentage or is it a contract where the rights are given to the manufacturer already had a contract with the factory that was made with the electric coal that was the air due to negligence it could be a high evulsion of the bank of Fonseca Zebroné who won the action in 70,000 contos and then lost because in the relationship with the fact that they were proven they took negligence to the bank of Fonseca Zebroné now, I went to the supreme my lawyer did not intervene the resources in the 5 days that should be interpreted by the anomalies that existed in the process did not intervene he went to the supreme and when he goes to the supreme the supreme's judges said there in a space can not now and here in return although it is known that there are anomalies because I had already passed the time I went everywhere, all the doors closed if you are seeing me how I can extremely difficult and on the part of your state there is no state take note of all these inventions that are made in our country I have the impression that I do not usually blame the state very much because all our state I do not usually blame a lot because they prefer go abroad to look for technology because the state is not how to say it is not the father we are now and that is true, we have the obligation of that agree, agree with that and at least in the protection that is what does not exist we see for example, we have the ex-president the deceased Jaime Filipe we have inventions of them the inventions for visual use the inventions that he brought international and worldwide for the deficient motors that he invented so much he ended up dying in the Alcaiton and in the end of his life they gave him a medal I want to get used to it and I can say it to you I want to say it because he died he is going to die, it can not be we were here for a few minutes with Vitorino and Moreira Fernandes who came to participate once again in the invention salon of Geneva where he won a goal d medal for the invention and more and a goal d medal of the dismantled vases that were bought by plants and a goal d medal for the double-deck bags of the president of Europe so coming at this moment looking for Portugal, not for me not for me, because I already have enough medals we come to look for Portugal for the armed forces in general and this one in particular a goal d medal and a goal d medal for all three goal d medals three goal d medals and one goal d medal Vitorino Moreira Fernandes is also proud of the armed forces that he belongs to he is in the mass of two I am in the mass of the sergeants of the port
