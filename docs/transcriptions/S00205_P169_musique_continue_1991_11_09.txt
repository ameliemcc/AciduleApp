the ground Cause your time is your money Your money is your guide You hide your bruises Honey Behind your watch And you run Through your life You barely find time to sleep Much less The bravery to weep Everyone's asking Where you going and when So you're laughing and passing The pain away you've been Yeah you You've packed up your past Put your memories on a train They ride a circular Drag Now darling, they'll be back Again just when you're sure Of that smile Just when you expect it At least They'll come looking For the bravery to weep Have you forgotten The story of your life Or maybe you just skipped a Chapter two A wild up, life is thick on me Your pace on the page Is quick on me You gotta stop Check that chapter and review A baby that fly can turn on you I had a dream I saw it On fire As more of us gathered The flames threw high And our breath frozen yet For it was hopelessly cold So we're on the road To the end of the road And we're on the road To the end of the road So we're all To the burdens Lay them on the cold And the light Fill the night And we huddled by the heat We were warm With the bravery to weep The light Fill the night And we huddled by the heat And we were warm With the bravery to weep Yeah Where will you go?
