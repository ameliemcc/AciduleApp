起來. At the end of the night, the briefs that will be presented by Marc Leder will be a review that we are not used to talking about as a joke. It's called Fortune and it's more about business men. But you'll see that we sometimes talk about Switzerland and that there are some interesting researches. We will then receive Laurent Baïf, who is the new secretary of the Vaudois Socialist Party. And we will end with Turkey, which is perhaps the goal of your holidays, who knows, since it seems that the Swiss franc is heavier than yesterday. We will take a balance on the situation at the level of the human rights and the economy in this country. Music But right away, Marc Leder speaks for the briefs of the day and the weather. We start right away with some news about the Afarayans, with whom the Count wants to support nomads better. The situation of cultural minorities in the Count of Bern, and especially those of the Bohemians, must be improved in general, to indicate today the Count's information office. The Bern government has proposed to the Grand Council a modification in the sense of the law on the encouragement of cultural activities. The goal of this modification is to offer additional parking spaces on all the cotton territory. The municipalities will be financially better supported. And we talk about the unemployment rate. According to the data published by the Fyampt, the number of unemployment rates is recorded in June, at 21,305, in regression of 1,221 cases in relation to May. The unemployment rate has been maintained at 0.7%. The drug and drug are still ravages, particularly in Zurich. The drug has made 22 victims in the city and the Count of Zurich during the first six months of the year. It has done more than twice as much as in the same period of the past year. And the list is only extended. Indeed, not less than three people have been at the scene of the drug abuse in the area of Zurich last weekend. Despite certain oppositions, the city's social services will soon replace the welcoming structures for the toxicoman. The graphic arts are open to conflict. The three indicators of graphic arts count on their positions after the failure to negotiate with the Association of Graphic Arts, ASAG. They qualify for incomprehensible the rejection of their proposals on the renewal of collective contracts in the branch. The indicators reveal the equality of wages between men and women and a additional week of vacancies for all. The branch has been under contract since April 1. And the Swiss army, news for the Swiss army's religion, the rabbi of Zurich, David Bolag, wishes to become the first rabbi of the Swiss army, which today is the service of almost protest. The rabbi, as an official, would like to assist the Israeli military to fight against the prejudices attached to the Jewish community. The decision to support the position of the Federal Military Department and the attitude of the two national churches. Today, all the free churches having done the same thing have been rejected. The Assurances live 9 million fronts per day. The Assurances have crossed the past 9.1 million fronts per day between 8.3 years ago, under the form of capital and insurance loans. The annual total of these investments has increased by about 12%, by 2.99% to 3.35 billion front. The distribution of the loans reveals that the funds paid to the foreigners to the expiration of their insurance are coming to mind. Then comes the travel loans, the unvalidated health loans in case of death. Cigarettes, DNR and ASCF in Fribourg. The civil chamber of the Kottonal Tribunal of Fribourg is on Monday, on the different that the Swiss association of cigarette manufacturers, ASFC in DNRSA. Due to the policy of the price that leads the chain of large surfaces, ASCF had suspended its deliveries of cigarettes. The tribunal has permission to determine if the decision of ASCF will be stopped or not by the law on the cartels. The judgment will be published in a few days. In the Kotton-de-Vaux, we will build pure fossil fuels. The effort has been taken from Tronton for the expiration of the oil in the Kotton-de-Vaux to contribute to the urban regions, thus causing a significant delay in rural areas. The Kottonal authorities are looking to complete this delay. They will propose in September the great advice of the credits to study the issue. It will also be about encouraging the development of pure fossil fuels. Investing 90 million francs will be necessary for this effect. After these new national, some new international, with an accident to be reversed, two passenger trains are in collision this morning near Toulouse in the south of France, causing 15 injured, so they are in a hurry. The accident occurred when one of the two trains percolated the other convoy, which was stopped, apparently after a panic. The shock that occurred at low speed caused the train to stop. A human error is likely to be the origin of this collision. New requests for Kabul are these, their transition, 9 people were killed and 24 others injured by the explosion of 11 single-seater requests in a district of Kabul, the Afghan capital. The Soviet agency accuses the Afghan war to be the origin of this attack. Kabul has become the main target of the Mujahideen for a month. According to the proof that 76 people were killed and 91 others injured by the explosion of 124 rockets on Kabul and other terrorist actions. In Brazil, there were no more rains with many injured, at least 57 people were killed and 50,000 were left without shelter in the state of Alagoas and Pernambuco, from the northeast of Brazil, causing rain that has been fighting for 11 days. The Gulf War, the satisfaction was unanimous in the world after the acceptance Monday by Tehran of the resolution 5998 of the UN ordered the immediate ceasefire between Iran and Iraq. The United States remains in the Gulf. The US Secretary of State George Schulz has declared that the American Navy would remain in the Gulf immediately. However, the United States is ready to directly negotiate a normalization of their relationship with Tehran. In favor of the Iranian-Iraqian ceasefire, has he added? The US Secretary of State has announced that the Iran-Iraqian ceasefire will be accepted in the UN. He has also said that the Iranian atomic center in Bochert and the Japanese chemical oil complex in Acheve, in Bondar, in Eman, were bombed by the Iraqi aviation, a radio station that adds to have three Iraqi aircraft. You have probably noticed that the Iranian-Iraqian peace is unfortunately not for tomorrow. Before we move on to the sport and to the weather, let me tell you a few things. First, the nomination of the head of the Center for Secondary and Higher Cedars in Leusanne. In his session on July 13, 1988, the State Council has named Mr. Pierre Mark Burnon, currently the master of mathematics at the Bunion's Gymnasium as the head of the Center for Secondary and Higher Cedars in Leusanne. The opening of the Center for Secondary will coincide with the closing of the Bélevedere and Mont-Benon gyms. The new Center for Secondary will be in Gymnasium and a high school. It will welcome its first students at the beginning of the school year 1991. The entry to the Center for Secondary and Higher Cedars is fixed on the first route 1989. During the school year 1989, it will be called to direct the Gymnasium at lausanne at the beginning of the year 1947. Mr. Pierre Mark Burnon is originally from Biond-et-Magneu. After secondary studies at the College of Morgue, he got the degree for primary high school at the Normal School of lausanne in 1967 and in 1974 the Mathematical Science and Science at the University of Leusanne. Titularized in 1975 at the Secondary College of Bétusie, Mr. Burnon was named at the Bunion's Gymnasium in 1980. Designed in quality of Duayin in 1981, he actively collaborated with the University of lausanne in the field of the School of Secondary and Higher Cedars. In 1935, Mr. Piguet was born in 1932, a specialised machine driver for the route and the route sector 5, which was the service of the municipal administration at lausanne in 1963. She addressed her congratulations on the occasion of her 25 activities within the municipal administration. In short, around France, the Dutch arrived in D'Arepuil to take the 16th stage. When in Spanish, Pedro Delgado remains well hooked to his major day. In football, there will be a lot of football, but in French, it is a very important sport. In the French, it is a sport that is very important in the future. In football, there will be a place tonight at Haro, the final of the Supercoupe, opposite Grassepère in Echatelle-Xamac, and abroad, its move from the side of the Soviet Union, the Dynamo Kiev, speaks of becoming a professional club. What interests you most for your holidays, the weather, for all Switzerland, the granary of the acid, at 2 thirds of its scale, is expected from the sun with a few rare storms, especially in the summer of the 0°C to 4000m. Is that all for this flash? We are now in Jean-Cello, like every Tuesday. The Red Cross, which takes care of the reception of refugees, is lacking space. It has opened a provisional centre in the Brix de la Vallée de la Jeunesse in Lausanne. The Red Cross calls on your generosity, our generosity, to bring draps and limes, even if it is used, it would be of great use. You can bring draps and limes, tomorrow between 8pm and 12pm, or between 14pm and 23pm, at the centre of the Civil Protection of La Vallée de la Jeunesse, Lausanne. Thank you for thinking. Hello, Jean-Cello. It is the time of holidays now, and sometimes it is at school. We wonder how we should leave our apartment during absence. Do we have to close all the stores? Do we have to sign that we are absent? Or is it not really necessary? Yes, it is a matter of questions that arise, because generally everything is going well. It is often something that we are underlined in this show, which is that generally everything is going well, but only once there is an accident, and it can have quite important consequences. And so, it seems that there are three aspects that we have to retain. The first is what you just said, to know in what state is left his apartment. The second is correspondence. What is going to happen during these three, four or five weeks, during which we will be absent? And the third is the key problem, for the case where something will happen in the building. So, on the first problem, I would say that the opinions are relatively controversial. Some say that it is not necessary to give an appearance of death in some way, because it can incite the Cambrioleurs to come, by saying there certainly is no one. Well, it also depends on what state we are in, because indeed, leaving windows without closed doors would have caused the same consequences as leaving them in the fifth floor. So, there is to keep account of the situation of the apartment in the building, and also keep account of what can represent the doors, because there are doors that represent no security, and make it just mark in the eyes of each one that this apartment is vacant of its occupants. So, let's say that I do not speak to myself, and we do not have enough experience at the block to be able to say do this or that, I think that there is at the top of each of us to say what is better that I do. However, what each one must know is that obviously before leaving, you have to consciously make the tour of the electrical switches to see if we have not left a lighted lamp, plates, kitchen plates or gas or to make it go over etc. So, in the end, before turning the key of its apartment, it is good, even if we are a little annoyed by this departure, to take 3 or 5 minutes to do the tour and say everything is fine, we have closed the windows, there will be a storm, we will not be flooded, we have closed all the doors that could crack, break a window etc. So, do the tour to check that we have taken all the precautions. Now, the correspondence. The correspondence can play around because if nobody cares about the courier during an absence, well, if it is an absence of a week or 15 days, it may not have consequences. But from the moment where we have 4, 5, 6 weeks even, then it can have consequences, especially if we receive a recommended letter, if there is nobody who will remove it, it will return purely and simply to the expeditioner, if there is a delay to be respected from which it is necessary or in which rather it is necessary to make an exception for example, the occasion of a rent or a bail resolution. So, in my opinion and according to our experiences, extremely important that someone takes care to remove the courier. So, there are two solutions. The first is that if we go to a chalet in Switzerland, we make a provisional address to the post and automatically the courier follows and therefore we receive it in the chalet where we go. But if we go, as this is my case, if we go to a camping, obviously a camping is a little more difficult and in this case we must charge a neighbor in the key of his chalet well, charge him to remove the courier and if there is anything, give him a telephone number or an address to which he could wait to say, there is such or such a plight that has happened, there is a mortuary, there is what you want to give next. Finally, to wait for us and inform us of what could have happened. And then, we must know that the post delivers the procurement in the right form that we can give to a neighbor to enable them to withdraw a courier who is recommended. So there are formulas that the post distributes and therefore we can use to let this neighbor take care of the post to withdraw a recommended object. That is how the correspondence concerns. Now, there is the problem of the key of the apartment. Why give a key of his apartment during his holidays? It is that a lot of things can happen during the time that we are absent. And I take here Article 8 of the rules and locative uses of the cantons de veau which says this if the access to the local louis is essential, in case of absence of the locator to the security of the building and the building the owner is allowed to go to the apartment. In the same case, the locator must be advised at the earliest. And the second line the locator will watch whether the place is accessible in case of emergency especially by putting a key in the house or in a neighbor's house. He will tell the owner where the house is In fact, it can happen an emergency, an inundation the locator above forgot his washing machine and then there and then you may have to intervene to immediately limit the damages. If no one has the key of your apartment we could try to force the door, which will make damages or then to say we can't penetrate, we're in trouble the damages, he will support them so it's better to give a key especially to the neighbor or to a neighbor but by warning the neighbor he knows well, it's him who will intervene immediately and it's him who must be able to say the key of the apartment of Mr. Y.Coup de M.Z. is to be put in the house I know that although the locator doesn't like to give a key, he says we're going to be absent they will come to screw our apartment so there is this which seems to me effective is to put this key back in a closed envelope with the envelope on which we marked its name and we mark key to Mr. Bollomé to open only in case of emergency and then, consequently it is only if there is an inundation or an advance in short, an urgent and important reason to enter this apartment that the one who will be the depositor of this key will be able to use it but otherwise, he won't use it because it is in a closed envelope so there, I think we can still trust or we can trust or to a neighbor by giving him an envelope under a key which is under an envelope and like that, we are calm whatever happens we will not be able to accuse us of not having allowed access to our premises and therefore to have been responsible of an important damage it can be deciphered sometimes very big very heavy that's how we speak, calm too that's what happens we say to ourselves, I took my precautions and my God, after we can go on a good vacation that's what we want in our auditors anyway, thank you Jean-Celot and you too, have a good vacation thank you during the holidays the daily basis is the succinct formation the sun and the heat encourage us to spend more time studying weather forecast in order to analyze through our society or to make very distant analysis painting the ruins of this society but on the side of the men of business, there is no question to forget to talk about money and that's what makes Fortune magazine his doubtful number which just came out is dedicated to a great article to Marc Rich, a character who was made to talk about him in Switzerland or where he has the seat of his society he is accused of grave fraud his associate his name is Pinky Green and he was sentenced to 325 years in prison by an American court Switzerland refused with an extradition on the one hand the American administration offers a $500,000 prize for information allowing his arrest on the other hand the business of this business is never so well carried his fortune is estimated to be $750,000,000 his company makes 13 billion of business numbers per year and it is the second world company Marc Rich has become the biggest businessman in the world in aluminum, in his competitors, in the metal business, there is Marc Rich and 40 small nits the article of Fortune states that Switzerland looks at Marc Rich as a model citizen he gives $350,000 per year for a foundation aimed at the support of Swiss mountain farmers he is also the sponsor and an effective supporter of the Oké Club Zug which was on the edge of the fight and to whom he gives $150,000 per year despite the risks Marc Rich would not have attempted to enter the United States it must be said that his lawyer is in Washington it is Leonhard Germant and he is an old advisor of former president Nixon Marc Rich was born in Belgium he arrived in the United States in 1941, he worked in Holland in Spain, in England his associate Pinky Green who we talked about earlier once answered the question what do you think about women's promotion but heard about it what seems very interesting Marc Rich is the trade with South Africa he has partially sorry he has partially abandoned the oil trade except for South Africa and that's what he does now his big companies have stopped trading with South Africa at least directly the port is open Marc Rich and he has a report from the research office of the maritime trade mentioned by Fortunes whose seat is in Amsterdam it is an organization that monitors the embargo in the South Africa according to this organization Rich has bought 6% of the oil imported by South Africa 6% is not enough but it represents more than a billion dollars the latest information is difficult to obtain we know for sure when a oil company bought by Rich has unloaded his cargo at Durban in 1987 but the profits are low Marc Rich's real strength is the aluminum trade he has made a base hand on the exports of aluminum from Jamaica one of the main producers of aluminum big companies like Alcoa have left Jamaica and the government had taken all the needs Rich has taken care of the exports of the country at a very low price we saw SEHAGA, the president of Jamaica arrive in Geneva in the private plane of Marc Rich at the Olympic Games in 1984 Marc Rich financed the displacement of the Jamaica athletes a man who likes sports as we see it, don't you think? Marc Rich's strategy, according to Fortune is the following the first courses are cyclical we have to have good relations with the producers when the courses are low and make a maximum profit as soon as the courses go up according to Edward Noter who is a Swiss ambassador and on any negotiation you give him you can pay when you want he can even lend you money his knowledge of the market is incredible if you are interested dear listeners Rich has the exclusivity of the sale of the plomb produced by the South African mine of Black Mountain one of the most important mines of the world at the beginning of the 80s Rich obtained the exclusivity of the plomb and two of them for the Soviet Union he was supported by the Soviet press the Isvestia during his process in the United States it seems that these Western competitors have warned that the Soviet Union paid its mining more than the other countries so the heads of Raznok who is the office of the Soviet trade who negotiated with Rich this head disappeared and Rich had to pay 20 millions of dollars of compensation for the Soviet Union he continues to trade with the Soviet Union but is no longer in a dominant position if you are worried about the vacation of Rich learn that he will spend them in Marbella in a property he built and where he was installed for 9.5 million dollars of installation of waste in a pool, in a cliff on the sea where singer Placido Domingo friend of Marquish likes to be privileged we do not know Placido Domingo nor Marquish nor his associate at Acidule instead we know a family with three children the father lost his job in April last year he will not touch his insurance only after the court hearing of the new next foot we are at the number of Acidule we sometimes say that sports and politics do not do good there is someone who is making lie this statement it is Laurent Baïf the new secretary of the Vaudois social party who is also the trainer of the Veuveve and an old member of the national team of the nation to make better knowledge we asked him some questions and more particularly we asked him what is the secret of the Vaudois social party I took my first job on the first of March it will take a little more than four months I take care of these functions so how do we find ourselves in a job like that of party secretary do we feel a little lonely lonely in any way since I am not the only permanent of the party and when you know what is the activity that is devoted to me it is a little different it is true that my contacts with the direction of the party are relatively little frequent since we have a office session once a week but finally I primarily have a direct line to all my activities which makes me feel like I have never lost otherwise if there is an important problem that arises I have very easy and very practical contacts also with the direction of the party with the party's commanders according to the areas where I have to intervene which makes me feel lonely no other measure at the moment so when we are party secretary we have a global vision of things that all the militants or the leaders of the party do not necessarily do not it also have some advantages in the sense that very quickly we become the pivot of what can happen in the party could it not present some danger? some danger for whom? I do not want to say horrors that could scare my responsibilities it is true that being in the Scraperia I see practically all the information that concerns the party that the courier who is a part of the courier certainly addressed to the president in person but in fact otherwise the totality of the information transits by me which makes it corresponds to one of my stages it is very good to receive all these information without making any synthesis and to keep a global vision of our activity within the party but in fact I do not think it could be a danger an disadvantage in any case a danger I wish for that it never becomes one in any case I do not have the intention to go beyond my skills and beyond the functions that have been entrusted to me by the party's responsibility I did not see you as a future dictator the renaissance but rather in person who comes very alone precisely because she centralizes everything and she is the only one who has this global vision this is what I wanted to say talking about danger if this danger is real it means that I would not have done my job since my job is actually to centralize information and to redistribute it since in fact there is no interest in having a criteria other than administrative and I pretend that the people who engage me would want me to do a work other than administrative purely so if we want a criteria of this kind well we need this criteria to act as a redistributor of information as an orientator of the activity of certain commissions as a motivator and as an incitator of activities that could be lost in view of the party's central direction your professional activity was that of a journalist you work as a trainer and you have to do with people who are also some kind of volunteers how can we do it? does the volunteer really exist? often we doubt it and how can we organize our work when we are even always redistributed and we have to clean volunteers how do you advise on both things? that is actually a problem that has been opposing me for several years now and I have been working as a semi-professional in contact with volunteers during the swimming and now I am actually redistributed to people who devote a lot of their time and their leisure and their passion to activities that are basically the same as mine the problem is to say that the concern or the people who are concerned need a commitment that surpasses the benefit in a swimming club or a sports club or any club the utility of the permanent the utility of the person redistributed is to ensure the liaison to be the engine of a club because the benefit has its passion it has its vision of things but it may not have the vision of the general good of society of the needs of society in the middle of a part the problem is really the same I have had the feeling of not changing work by changing functions by passing from sport to the world of politics it is the same it is also this role centralising and orientating the movement's orientator the people who devote a passion have a punctual view of the world a punctual view of the activity of the party even the leaders the leaders their work it is not to really make the party work it is to direct so it is necessary to have someone who has time to devote because it is his profession to this function of transmission I am a transmission courier and the transmission courier must be there all the time it must not be there only when it wants to that's the problem you are a municipal council member I think you have a sports spirit we often have the spirit of competition when you are a sportsman you have been part of the Swiss team of swimming the national team of swimming how do we live in a minority party and who despite the great quality of the people defending ideas or the ideas that are defended it is worth to take it how do we live that when we have a spirit of competition when we have a spirit of competition we are trying to win but we are trying to win by respecting certain rules that is to say I prefer to say to an opponent you are right that's right I think the line of directors is exactly what had planned my party and it's called because I respect a person who has a right idea I can even have an opinion that, in my opinion, is not the same because I see further very often people who have just ideas among the right people there are a few, they have views in short they do not see the long term they do not see the general interest they see generally interest in a small group where I can admit the positions of others I can even adhere but the goal is still that the philosophy that supports my activity, that supports the activity of my party and that I consider as just that this philosophy can be applied in the reality of the party because I consider what is the best for the the largest number, for the majority of people so of course as a sportswoman I learned to lose it's very boring but I have always practiced individual sports so as an individual sportswoman I know that if I want to win it's up to me to make the effort it's not to wait for others whether they are my opponents or my teammates to wait for others in the way I can win so it's a factor of additional motivation that is to say that if I did not manage to win at the municipal council to win, I say well in Guillemets because I am not a fanatic of the will to take it to any extent in the context of a municipal council or something like that so if I did not manage to win that is to say if I did not manage to win the people in the municipal council it's that you have to find another means so the other means is either better arguments or a better personal attitude or rules of theatrical play or things like that because we can always influence people without changing their ideas but simply by changing the way they are going to say and then if it does not work because there are blockages in the municipal council in all the legislative there are blockages in the presence and that in fact the parties organize in such a way that decisions are almost taken during group sessions that precede the municipal council session so if the environment in which I have to defend these ideas does not work well, well you have to find another environment, so the other environment it can be commissions a subject that holds me in mind and where I would prefer to pass these ideas I always try to go to commissions because in commissions generally people they come without preconceived ideas we will have said it well in their party you will try to ask questions about this about that, we think about this rather than that but in fact in commission we are very free, we talk with experts who bring us knowledge about a subject which one and then we make our opinion depending on each response of the expert of each way of asking questions so there you have all of a sudden people who can convince themselves and I do not say that I do not let myself convince I play the game, that is to say I am not focused on ideas and I do not simply to embody others, I let myself convince if I find that things are convincing so that's the other environment and then the third environment which is evident is that of contact with the population so you are in contact with people all the time, whether in the store whether with people from the palace or for me with people from the society in which I am part well these people, I do not make political propaganda but when I speak I always speak in the function of my ideas that is to say when I speak of the rain or the rain, when I speak of the activity of sports, when I speak of the activity of international, regional politics and whatever and people know that I am a socialist and then I present my ideas as being that of Mr. Laurent Baïif member of the socialist party but I am not a flag bearer simply everyone of us has ideas and speaks in the function of these ideas if in a friendly environment I manage to explain how my opinions are made and then that these opinions can be considered as valuable by other people I consider that I have won but no more I would not like to go for an hypocrite who only thinks to convince people and to embarrass them simply it is part of the life of everyday when you talk to someone even if you want to transmit information which is a neutral theory this information is interpreted by the person who receives it in such a way that she will become either a fact that she will accept it or a fact that she will not accept it so if you are looking to bring something to the person who you are talking to and you try to make sure that she thinks like you since you consider that it is the right opinion so you have to present the facts in such a way that the person thinks that your opinion is an opinion that is defended when did you get to do politics you women, Laurent Baïf? I must say that I had a a curious path that is to say that when I was in the gymnasium when I quit writing at the time I was not at all in the movement that I joined afterwards since I was quite anarchist on the right I was against all the structures and when I arrived at the university the fact of political arrivance made me in contact with people who had totally different ideas of the ones I had met in the middle where I was going since I come from a small bourgeois family a blue collar which is a bit too much in fact I met people coming from abroad already at a period where May 68 was coming to be declared I started in August 1978 the university with French people who showed me a view of the world that did not correspond to the little comfort and to the well arranged orders that I had analyzed until now and that gave me another opinion of the man I had a very good opinion of myself and I came to have a very good opinion of the general man that is what made me consider that instead of fighting for me I also considered that each person was worthy of respect and each individual was worthy of my help as I could bring him to me so I had a very clear turn on the left of course being in contact with people who were in the extreme left movement I also participated in debates on the platform of Swiss students things like that always having the impression that I was a theater piece with a certain distance and then I realized that these ideas that had resonated in my head for a few years had made their way and gave me a new place to analyze the situation global analysis and I considered that charity and solidarity were maybe... I don't like charity so nobody likes it it was pretty nice to the individual but it was maybe better if it was structured and then I realized that the party that was best suited to what I wanted was the socialist party I'm not a revolutionary I'm rather a reformist so I wouldn't be feeling comfortable in a part of extreme left or in a hard left especially because I consider that it lacks humor in these areas and I would even say that in the left, it lacks humor it's like a place where I have a little more pain to get used to because people who I usually use in a rather particular sense love nonsense and all and nonsense is generally appreciated by the left so I then thought that the socialist party was better suited to what I wanted to defend and then in fact I was called by press from Ontario and from Benévole you were talking about it more it exists very well it's even very enthusiastic but it's not many so it's obvious that each party that must remind them of their Benévole's important commitment recruits Benévole and they are all happy when these people come themselves to the party so I approached a little bit of someone from the socialist party and people were all happy that I came and I was always welcome and very quickly I found myself in the municipal council Thank you we were able to get to know you better Laurent Daïf and I think we have the opportunity to hear you again on our decisions, thank you The Turkey is perhaps the goal of your holidays this summer if you believe in the Ebtos it is indeed the country where the Swiss franc is the biggest What is happening in this country that has been signed for a few times already the European Convention on Human Rights Human Rights is the biggest country in the world and it is the most important in the world What are the human rights are they respected what is the economic situation we have two guests tonight around the table of the CIDUL and we also met Jacques Schneider, lawyer who participated as a delegate of the Human Rights League at the process that took place recently of the two secretaries Sargin and Koutlu since a while the Turkish authorities have taken over a democratization of their institutions this is translated by the adoption of a new constitution and the election held in autumn 1987 elections that have reaffirmed the current power this process has not yet ended some parties of opposition remain forbidden even though some organizations are indicating the 16 November 1987 Nihat Sargin and Haidar Koutlu I'm not sure if I'm right that's good political refugees in Europe respectively the Turkish office and the Turkish Communist Party have entered Ankara accompanied by a delegation of European parliamentarians and journalists the return was motivated by the will to participate in the democratic opening Mr Sargin and Koutlu were arrested as soon as they arrived and put in place a watch for a long time moreover they were tortured interrogation 24 hours on 24 the first days with the eyes closed and the obligation to stay on a chair I have high pressure on the sensitive parts of the body ears, neck, neck suspensions hands are tied by a rope then in a pulley the prisoner is suspended by his arms Mr Koutlu application of electricity on the hand and sexual organ after the body was soaked in water, injection of unknown substances in the body they were put in a watch in December and released after the death of a live protestant which took place in public opinion 17 other people were also accused of this we met last Sunday during a picnic organized by the Turkish community Jacques Schneider lawyer in Geneva who was made in Ankara as an observer in the name of the Human Rights League we asked him to explain what happened during this Koutlu and Sargin process Koutlu and Sargin were arrested then arrived in Ankara accompanied by a 30 European parliamentarians and journalists we must know that they were accused of violating the Turkish penal code which was taken back in 1936 of the Mussolini penal code these dispositions repress anarchist, socialist, communist ideas and non-Chemalist Kemal Ataturk being the founder of the current Turkish Republic in the 1920s Koutlu and Sargin were put in a watch for 19 days during these 19 days they were going to have different tortures they are now translated before the security of the state in Ankara and they are now threatened with penalties which can exceed 500 years of prison for both this process is directed against them but also directed against all people who would be willing to participate in the opening of the democratic promise by the government in fact with the measure of the test where if Koutlu and Sargin had to go out innocent this could encourage other current thinkers to publicly protest in Turkey which is not the case for now have we not seen the lawyers of these two people being arrested? yes, so the two main lawyers Koutlu and Sargin were arrested in December shortly after the arrest of their client which means that they are reproached according to the fight for Koutlu and Sargin democracy was valuable by making these declarations the lawyers would be guilty of propagating communist ideas of the laws that were approached by Koutlu and Sargin in other words this process opens when from the beginning there was a lot of torture but also considerable attacks to the law of defence so in June the process opens a number of foreign observers who you are Jacques Schneider is going to Ankara and what is happening then how does it unfold the law of man and by the Swiss League of Laws I was not the only observer we were about 70 foreign observers so an English law representing the Laws of Man of the British Parliament and personalities like Miki Steyodorakis singer-songwriter I add that Turkish personalities are also mobilized in defence of Koutlu and Sargin the writer Yacher Kamal who is also known to us who is for most of the time translated into French that's it and then an accusation was established I think the process opens how does it unfold a process in Turkey is it widely open to the public when we arrived in front of the court room when we said that this room was small there were foreign observers 450 Turkish bar who were mobilized in defence of the law and who wanted to enter the room to defend their clients Koutlu and Sargin were accused of 15 others there was also about a thousand Turkish citizens who were gathered in front of this room of the court the doors were open in a very selective way some foreign observers could enter I could even enter some journalists, some lawyers and for the rest the doors were closed in other terms the Turkish citizen who would have wanted to be able to participate as an audience in this process, couldn't and in fact the process hasn't yet taken place so some people could enter but we only had the premises of a process I would say that the process started and was interrupted as early as possible it's something unusual because the criminal process usually begins and stops when the verdict is given that is to say that there is a series of audiences that continue and this to prevent the defendant from underpinning too much pressure and in a desperate spirit so it didn't happen since the number of foreign observers since the protests that were raised by the defense the court decided to send the process back in two weeks so it seemed to be expected to encourage the coming of foreign observers who were in the process to find a large echo in the Turkish press so how did we get when we came to support people who were imprisoned for their opinions how did it happen do you feel in public opinion a support do the police watch the protests or do they leave people in all freedom in front of the court but it seems that this person was arrested the day of the process but it was neither known nor foreign observers regarding the reception of the Turkish population we were welcomed we had the honour to be invited a big banquet held in a restaurant open in a big public garden in Kara during this banquet Teodorakis and Yashir Kamal we even heard very well known singers in Turkey singing poems of Nazim Hikmet very well known poets but who were communist for which these works were forbidden so we had the feeling of really contributing to create new spaces of freedom for Turkish citizens we are coming to hear Jacques Schneider who participated in the opening of the process of two secretaries Kutlu and Sargin Mustafa for a while but you have been in touch with your country and you know what is happening what can you tell us about the current situation regarding the life of everyday life how does it happen for people how is life, how is work do we find affordable housing do basic food have affordable prices yes for a few years the government has not been able to control the inflation so the purchasing power of the population that comes in Turkey is decreasing day by day the other day I had read an article the purchasing power of the population is decreasing in April like the 70s so it has been back in the same level as in the 70s we can see that we are looking at the economic that Switzerland is one of privileged partners in the commercial level of Turkey can you tell us of course because after the state Switzerland has become the first country that invests in Turkey because the first of the world is not very expensive secondly they are in good hands with the government on the other hand there are many exchanges for example the last the platusses maybe last year the platusses planes after there are credits Switzerland is the first country in Europe that gives credits on the banks but I do not know because the credits that Switzerland gives are not long it is not long more and more there are 40 billion of debt in Turkey from the outside before the state it was 16 million and now it is 40 million and this debt is always between 5 and 10 years that it needs to pay and it is about 4 billion more than 4 billion the interest of each country the economic situation of Turkey and the investments the inside it drops there is no it does not create jobs and it creates unemployment normally there is a big amount of unemployment it increases every day in fact we have known countries that returned to democracy and socialism was Spain Portugal it seems that very quickly human rights were restored in these countries quite quickly in Turkey we realize that it is not the case even if Turkey has signed conventions against torture in 1984 already we see that they do not respect them how do you explain that? Yes democracy already the current government they do not have democracy because there were elections recently last December with 37% 36% are in power already it is not democratic that and the rest the 74% the idea of 64% we do not see in the parliament they are not represented in the parliament that is the first thing second thing democracy of course the rights are sometimes for example there are thousands of political prisoners so because of their ideas they think differently and there are still procedures against the disc syndicate so it was the second big syndicate of Turkey which is forbidden even it is soon they are controlled by the state we do not know what we are doing these laws are re-indicated the benefits of the disc that they give like the process is not yet over we do not know there are more than 100 syndicalists who are trained in a process more than 2000 more than 2000 and even even now even now they stop the syndicalists for example the General Secretary when he arrived in Turkey Kutlu and Sargin they stopped a syndicalist because they were in their favor and they said they are also for democracy even they stopped they are in prison now so it is enough to declare to defend the rights of the man who is imprisoned to be associated with a bad guy that's it and then we risk when we are stopped for these conditions because the penalty exists in Turkey and it is one of the things planned by the penal code it is a planned deduction for socialist or communist activities but of course there are about 159 process they are at the parliament they are wHaïti ng there if it goes they are the majority to pass 159 people they can execute they will be executed even there was the other day a minister as they say a minister of justice if I know that by executing 159 people it will be calm we will not hesitate to do it they are afraid of the pressure of public opinion we can see that Turkey is not insensitive to demonstrations in favor of prisoners or the rights of the man in Turkey and that it is important the pressure of public opinion is what Jacques Schneider said in an interview despite the repression for example the mayor of political prisoners they don't stop their activity they are re-signing despite the repression there are many associations founded by the man I can quote there is also a doctor against the war association a world association they are open and they were forbidden but they didn't give up what you know they didn't give up and now they are fighting to open this association because the association of the country was closed there was an interdiction and the leaders were imprisoned for 4 or 5 years so if we declare pacifist we are imprisoned because it all depends on the article 140 to 140 so as soon as they don't want anything they put it in this article for example there is a socio-democrat they are simply cured they don't have any communist or anything else they condemn the article 140 to 140 it allows all the exaggerations it allows everyone they can play on it as they want do you think these articles will be biffed and removed from the constitution? well, the two general secretaries they have aimed at these two articles because these two articles prevent all the democratization so the two general secretaries they don't only sell it for everyone for the progressists for the communists, for the anarchists for the cure, for the Turks for those who have it in favor of democracy the suppression of these articles? yes, exactly and for this, if they let it free it's a legal fight because it's the general prosecutor the military the prosecutor who takes care of this process he said it would be a process of another century he said it himself it would be the process of the century and for this we really say it would be a process of the century because since the 30s and these two articles they entered the constitution of Turkey and they still have it but these articles will always be the democratization it won't exist so what can we do when we are here in Switzerland and we want to help with an opening for democracy in Turkey can we write, can we support movements? of course because Turkey has a lot of injuries even governments can't overcome Europe yes and it's based on the European standards and a lot of ties with Europe so also the desire to enter the common market for this I think that the power of Europe, like Switzerland can do a lot for the solidarity for the democracy of Turkey to protest the embassy to rule the government even the president we can sensitize the situation in Turkey in Switzerland to make it better known if someone tells you to leave on vacation in Turkey what would you advise them? but it can go, another country it's a wonderful country and on the other hand I can't say that we see in a country where democracy is free we must know that too thank you Mustafa that's how the news of the acidule ends we will talk about it because it's the Nyon festival and we have sent it each year and it's Alain Ichef who will talk about it with his usual talent so I'm talking about the world for this opening concert on 19th of July 1988 at the Palléo festival the heat was intense on the highway the vehicles were already very many at around 16.30 if I could get to the festival as quickly as possible finally I am when I write these lines it's 7 o'clock, everything goes for the best the car will park with deep ice in the aperitif, the aperitif far away a serene retent the Ichef comes to end the Tokiwoki greys then the words are gone here at the musicians bar I'm in the shade and it's quite bearable I put the Naga in front of me the little beautiful beast which I learned today from the technician Kudelskian 28 years old this Naga 1960-1988 thanks to him, the technician I hope to make you live one of the best moments of this festival as much as you will come immediately A different seat is needed and for my part it is so that it charmed me so do not wait for you dear readers to interview you, responsible singers, artists of the Rocks of these days that we hope to laugh as soon as they are, by the way with my little recording time I want to go on the public side of the insolite characters of this festival maybe the little ones, the anodines which have a lot to say but not all the time I turn the page with my magical recording beast I will try to make you live the space of a few Sundays the joys of the camping very close the ambiance just before, just after I say the space of a few Sundays because what I will record I will present you in the days of the Sunday and then also the hitchhikers, the police the laughter and the songs the extra shows also taken like that without effect on the live of everyone, maybe the laughter in any case, mixed with the dust mixed, mixed but also every day at around 19.30 we will take a date, every day of this week the space of a few minutes and it will be with pleasure that I will tell you my moments of the day, my crazy night or my beautiful day, it's never been this day, it wants to be discovered I have never seen Gershpati, to participate in the TV but the TV, as my neighbor says well at 19.00, it's just this product that will open the fires and besides at 9.00 now, you know it and it's just this product that is being indeed happening and we end the night in Botte with the Stronglers here normally we should make a break a musical break because there is a half hour that has just been blown and now at the time where Cricelyne is 18.15 people just came in, a huge crowd doors just opened, I turn the page we should also make a musical break because I just lost my beautiful white style I just found it, which I was so we gave me a red at the end it's not the same thing sometimes we attach to objects more otherwise all the same to people people come to visit on the field it hasn't really started yet so we wait, I follow my walk passing by the Lerene, but not a here, a small field of charm and on my badge presentation obviously here I find a little paradise, a few centimetres from the Gronysen, you have heard but it's necessary to have a badge a pool, that the shadow covers the little by little and in front of the pool, giving on the lake a superb pelouse where this bronze that the Conaillade absolutely superb my belly, my wife listen and I take the opportunity to embrace a dog and a cat that has not yet given.
