 *** Another video *** *** *** *** Ah, en� truths! Captions make it, that's us sponsors, in matching clothes andfinitely, not! Captions become a champion of the national skills, the world champions. Good evening François! I think it's time for a big contest. We're going to平 friendly this evening, we will talk MOEES, Kayak guessed no, rather Aquabasis to theassis panel. Our guest is Gamegames 약간 F��비 Praetor Crazy What a reason! Melting is like a wake, about a what's not any practice. So nervous. He's doing it unconsciously. That was in the car. It's not a practice. You have a glass plate when you go straight in the turn. The same movement is done in a few tones. But now it stops. I think in comparison with the car at least with some some acrobatics we can do with his car. So you were wrong. Cri-Cri had already done tests. Yes but I think we don't turn with his car with a paga or with a frame. I don't know. What is the name of the frame? Ram, paga, the paga. That's right. Very good. So François, so it's a first or not? It's the 7th edition. 1986, the first edition. Yes. Why did you create a test like this only dedicated to skimotting? For Lausanne, our club of Keia Club Lausanne it was the occasion to organize something in the Romain framework. In Lausanne, unfortunately, there are not many rivers. There is the flanc which is a bit polluted. And a bit polluted too. We often have to move far to look for rivers and to navigate. And then it is also for us to take care of winter, a calm period. In general, we stop doing kayaking in October-November, at least some bites that hang on the ice. But in general, it stops at this period. So I was afraid of not understanding but it actually happens in the middle of the air. It's fun to do roll-on rolls. That's good. So skimotting is the technique that consists of returning without embarking once a situation has ended a bit badly. Once we have shaved. So it is a judicial movement of the pagaille and the hips to put back on the embarking. So we do it with shaved hair to see if we can... Normally, skimotting is about saving that for because often the goal is to be able to continue to navigate without swimming in the river. Let's say we breathe badly under water. That's pretty sure. So finally, we made a rescue solution, an experiment. But what happens in the case, we go down in a sign. So skimotting in general starts by learning in a swimming pool. Because navigation starts in April, rivers are often cold. When you learn to do kayaking it's always pretty painful to be in a river. So what we do in general is that we take advantage of winter and then from the near of a pool of a community of a location to go and learn how to skimot a pool. Is it difficult to skimot? It takes some time. It's one of the most difficult to do kayaking. And what it takes on how much time? Is it one of the first maneuvers that we learn? Or do we have to have a certain technique to have a certain routine in this kayaking sport to be able to begin to learn to skimot? So we can take it in a way. It's a movement that we can very well do a swimming pool without knowing how to navigate. Because the technique of kayaking navigation is to go straight and master obstacles. Skimotting, we are on the spot. It's another technique, we put the boat straight. So we can very well learn to skimot without knowing how to do kayaking. It's about mastering your fear under water and doing the right movement to address the boat. And where does this term skimotting come from? I never thought of skimotting, cinema. There's something I think. I never thought of why we call it skimotting. I once heard that skimots themselves don't skimot. I don't know. It's a word that I've been loving for a long time. I think it's a good thing for me. It's the origin of kayaking. And in this competition, I'm a little bit innocent about kayaking, but is it possible to do it with two people? Can this technique be applied at the same time? Is there a category where there are two people who will practice this sautage? We generally talk about kayaking when we see someone in a boat or a small boat lying down. In fact, there is the canoe and the kayak. In the kayak, the navigator is seated. The feet in front, he has a juke, a rope that turns his hips and makes the joint with the boat so that the water doesn't come in between. There is also the Canadian canoe which is a long boat that looks like a kayak, but we have the kneeling position. We are kneeling in the boat with a kind of push to sit. And in both cases, we can skim up? In both cases, we can skim up. It is in both cases of skim up. Is there a position that is more favorable to skim up than the other? In Canada, canoe and canadian, the movement is easier to do. But in general, when we learn the kayak, we learn the canoe and kayak technique, we start with the kayak. I hear the kayak navigation in the river, not only the kayak, touristic navigation on the Ardeche, for example. In Ardeche, there is no juke, we will find very few navigators who skim up, not just once we have skimped, the boat is filled with water. So you really have to know, want to do the kayak to learn this technique. François Vuille, what are the qualities of a good kayak navigator? So, you have to master a very good technique in the river, you have to know how to know the dangers, recognize the dangers. And then, you have to go, you also have to have a little bit of peace and that's on the rivers. Because it's like a ski, when you want to skim a big slope, if you hesitate, often it ends up very bad. At some point, you have to go. We are waiting for important speeds, no, we are going a little bit faster than the current of the river. But we don't do that at great speeds in the kayak. We do a kayak, there are two techniques, there is the sports navigation technique, where we have to avoid rocks, we can extend that to the slalom navigation, where we have to pass through the doors. And our technique is the navigation in the river, fast race, so that's the descent kayak. So there we go a little faster, I don't know, I could be about ten kilometers, for example, but we will never go very fast. About this Swiss ski-motor champion, what is the rule? What will determine who will be the first or the second? Apart from that, you have to go around and go up. So for this competition, it is about showing the speed and endurance. So our competition is composed of two phases. There is a first phase of speed, where it is about doing three skis-motors in the fastest possible time. So it goes from 10 seconds to 5 seconds, the best competitors do one or two of 5 seconds for three skis-motors. It's very fast. We don't have the time to see them do it. We don't have the time to see them turn, they are already back. The main job is obviously underwater. Do we have access to, if I can say, an aquatic vision? Can we see what is happening underwater in the context of these competitions? So a covered pool, generally water is extremely clean, we can see very well what is happening below. It is clear that if the pool has a bubble, we can imagine a certain pool, it doesn't exist, we can see better what is happening underwater. But the movement is so fast, that we can't see much. And at the Blesanne club, there are good champions, if I'm not mistaken, everything is going well, let's hope for them. Talk to us about this club, which is the Blesanne club, which we don't know very well. So for Blesanne, the club was born in 1942. And then there were several key periods in the kayak club. At the beginning it was a club of friends who sailed in 1942, it was kayaks in the water, we were going down the river, because we didn't want to break them. Then there were calmer periods, with phases where it was the kayak in the family. There were phases where there was a wave, with the search for new members, for new members, for training kayaks in the case of youth and sport. And in the last years, the kayak club decided to promote the kayak with the young people, very young people, because we chose to do that at school level. You have to be a lover of nature to do kayaks. We read the technique, the competition, a need to find yourself in nature, to find yourself in a particularly pleasant site. Can you say that kayaks are lovers of nature? Yes, quite so. What do you expect? The desire to navigate, to master some techniques, or rather the desire to find yourself in the open air and to appreciate a beautiful landscape? We find these two optics. The kayak club has these two visions of things. The kayak in a virgin nature, the trees, the water, the tranquility, and another one, a little more competitive, or in search of mastering the technique first of all. Competition, slalom, and drawing competition. So, in fact, how much is your club? The club has 150 members. On these 150 members, there are about 70 to 80 members who regularly do one, two, three, or even every weekend. Two, three times a year, or even every weekend of the kayak. And then, a dozen monitors that surround, frame young people and adults on the trips. In general, we usually have a trip every weekend. And precisely, at what age is it possible to start sailing in the kayak? In the kayak, is there a minimum age where you have to start to master these techniques? And in the end, it is accessible to everyone, whatever their age. In general, we are aware that the kayak will start to interest young people from 11 to 12. There is a matter of material problems. We find especially boats for adults, not many boats for young people. And then there is also a relationship between the strength of the child and the water movements. So it is not that easy that 11 is the age where we can start to sail in the kayak. I have a question. If we do not want to compete in the kayak, is your club open to us? Simply for the pleasure of discovering nature? Absolutely. Because what we try to do is a basic training. We will learn the technique of the kayak because it is primordial, I think. The kayak needs to be mastered by the current. It will be progressive. At first, we will go on very easy rivers, see on the lake. We train on the lake every week from April. And then little by little, we will face difficulties on the river. The first two years of the kayak, we will put effort on the technical training. And then we will be able to offer a training on the rivers. So maybe two more family training. And then, next to that, some kayaks will get ready for the competition. So we have a competition course, a competition group that will take care of the hopes and maybe push this discipline a little more. So in fact, a logical progression. Either we go in the direction of the pleasure kayak, or we can access by graduation a competition elite kayak. And how do we train during the year when we do the competition? What physical maintenance will the kayakist and the kayakists do? So for our competition group, for example, training is all year. So we will start the year maybe the fall, when we have finished making kayaks. So it starts with a swimming training, for example, skiing, the swimming master. Because it is very important to be able to behave correctly in the water. We will navigate the week in the river. Our group does a training two to three times a week on the lake. And also on the rivers, on the training zones. Prevised especially to do the competition. And do a little bit of a walk like a ski track and put the skis to make the doors. And then, besides that, elite competitors train in physical culture and in training to improve their physical condition. Because a competition of this kind lasts for two or three minutes. And everything will play in this time. So it is clear that the physical condition is essential. There is the technique and the physical condition. Agility, rapidity, optimal physical condition. Three of the essential qualities of the kayaking. We will find ourselves in a few moments at the descent of the Femme Acid, the L'Azanoise region to talk about kayaking and this championship of skiing. Artmango on the Femme Acid, the L'Azanoise region radio your Panorama Magazine we are talking about skimotting in the company of François Vuit. I remind you that tomorrow between 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm, it will be Aquarium, the 100th of Aquarium. We will welcome John Bonvin and Bertrand Picard we will talk about aeronautics in the company of these two gentlemen. We will talk about the LM and light aviation with John Bonvin and of course Ballon à gaz in the company of Bertrand Picard. So, skimotting on the 102.8. What will be the result of this Swiss championship that will take place? At the Piscine Dumont, on March 7th, Sunday March 7th. And we saw that there was a group a little pleasant, a group competition within the kayaking I arrived from L'Azane. What number of members will be in this competition? We are waiting for 80 to 100 competitors for this competition. And it will be only Swiss or international? There are French who are registered, maybe Italians who will come. French who will come from the northern Pas-de-Calais, they have been moving for too many years, each year to come to the competition. What kind of categories are in this Swiss championship? I think there are men and women but then what is the section? It's a bit like most sports. There are the minimums, the cadets, the juniors, the seniors, the veterans. And for each of these categories we can compete in kayak, a canoe and monoplace or a canoe and bi-place. How do you determine the category in which we race? I'm not talking about the age but I'm talking about the long-term condition of a canoe and a kayak. This is based on technical criteria it's the boat itself. It's based on personal technical criteria that we chose to compete in kayak. The competitor can choose some kids in the kayak competition and a canoe. We don't have the same sensations with these two modes of navigation. We saw that the one who was taking the boat for the night, there was a lot of rapidity but is it the style to see if the person is very sure of her or when she gets up is it in the boat or in the boat or in the field? Not at all. We talked about rapidity there is a second test which consists of doing one minute of skimout. That's a tough notion. It's really a marathon it ends very difficult. In the meantime the best competitors skimout 30 times in one minute that is to say a cadence every 2 seconds. It's really the washing machine. Yes, totally. How does it happen in the pool? Is the boat held one end to the other? So exactly. We attach the boat with a rope attached to the river the front and the rear and then the skimout boat between two. So we focus only on skimout there is absolutely no problem there is no control of the position of the pool. And in this championship there are many categories that will skimout. There are also children there will be minimums children of 11-12 years obviously adapted to their morphology. For the youngest we will even shorten the competition for the place to do one minute in the next 30 seconds there are already enough They are already fixed after 30 seconds. Are there rules that say that you should not do certain things? For example, I do not know things like eating between time Do you have two skimout between two skimout Are there really things that we do not have the right to do? There are some rules the motoring is to separate the competitors know that you have to go the top of the head and then the top of the head is given for example the three quick skimout we have to finish with the top of the head and the body immobilized the time is not taken if the competition continues there is a master of the start and the stop and then for the competition on the minute you will have to finish on top and not under or under the water so we must finish the competition Is it possible to do this when you are out of water in the initial position? Before we leave it's almost the end I hope I will not ask you again a question that has already been asked In natural scenery in Switzerland, where is it possible to practice this sport because I imagine that it takes a certain depth to practice the skimout So the skimout is generally practice after a fall after a difficulty and generally behind a rock there is a zone where there is water saying that you have to do something like 50 or 60 cm of water to skimout There is not more In general, we arrive like that it is the arrival that the head hits the ground but it is more the reason for which we take a helmet but in general there is water that we skimout because there was a difficulty before, there was a rock or something, always behind a rock there is a deeper zone So generally there is a lot of navigation in Kayak in Switzerland In any case, the places you like in your opinion, François Vu For the majority of the members of the club a nice river and the Versois we will skimout every time to the Versois otherwise for more difficult rivers there is the Sarine the passage of the Gérignaux sometimes it's a rock encampment and instead of skimout we often move to France because for us, your fingers it is also easy to go to Tonant so on the Drense certainly people know the region where we do rafting there is also the possibility to apply skimout I have just a question in practice, it is just at the level of these championships when you have to do for a minute just to know how it happens do we turn all the way over ourselves or is there a predilection side in general the kayaking has a predilection side and turns like a washing machine it turns, it turns but there is always a turn in the clock very well, François Vu thank you very much for coming tonight in these places I wish you good luck for this championship thank you we wish you a very nice follow-up and very spectacular and then when we meet again on the next episode we will be back on the 30th for Aquarium the 100th yes, I understand I take the microphone to invite everyone to come and see how it is at the Piscine du Monde on March 7 very well, thank you François Vu and see you next week for the Panorama Magazine Christian Cormin Buff Stéphanie Leuenberg www.piscineduemann www.piscineduemann.com
