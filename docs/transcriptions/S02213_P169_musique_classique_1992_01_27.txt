 auss켜  unless you use and ouch you Do opera Ze n고 3 do gr nghie uh Nou alo poumy-cen kuza ar. How did I... however, I- A kon a recreate the same story to the whole story to this subject. The same… It's now... ...t le... ...sure le planche. Et pui sur tout travailler la musique avec des grand chef. Sinon onn aurait jamais en tout cas j'aurai jamais l'occasion. Donc ça c'est une chose très importante pour moi. Est-ce qui veut dan dire que les opéras sont dirigés par des grand chef? Ah oui, onn a eu des très grandes rencontres. Onn en toutes les années, je crois. Iske s'aurai un niveau irrégulier ou bien si c'est kon même asi constant? Onn a la chance, je crois, d'avoir une directrice qui choisit extrêmement bien ses programmes. Oton n'y ofan. Onn mi renton amage ce soir. Bien qu'elle soit un autre radio. Qui choisit extrêmement bien les chanteurs et justement les chefs d'orchestre. Surtout que maintenant onn est sorti des critères habituelles, des castafiores énormes, qui font leurs bell notes, donc c'est des gens jeunes, qui sont des très bons comédiens, qui jouent. Donc il y a toute une transformation de l'opéra qui est passionante pour nous. Catherine Despont. Bien, comment ce que... Oton qu'est ce qui vous a attiré? Ce qui m'a attiré moi c'est la scène. Particulièrement la scène. Bon c'est clair que je chantais depuis longtemps l'idée de chanter de l'opéra m'a attiré, mais c'est surtout de faire de la scène et d'être en contact avec les metres en scène, les planches. Et puis un peu aussi le fait que je découvrais l'opéra j'ai découvert l'opéra comme ça. J'avais dit... C'est la meilleure manière de découvrir l'opéra. Je trouve. Oui oui. On se passione vite pour l'opéra, quand on est de ce côté-là. Et vous Fabienne Nair, Manger? Moi c'est un peu la mème chose que Catherine. Bon j'étais au conservatoire. J'étais surtout attirée par le loratorio et le lead. Et puis je connaissais pas du tout l'opéra. Puis en même temps j'aime beaucoup tout ce qui est... tout ce qui est scène, tout ce qui est théâtre, enfin. Et puis c'est en fait en hasard si je suis arrivée là. C'est que j'avais une amie qui était au conservatoire et qui pouva pas participer à un opéra. Et puis elle m'a demandé si je pouvais la remplacer. Et puis c'est comme ça que j'ai commencé. Alors j'ai très vite pris goût. Et puis maintenant je peux pratique... je passe toutes mes journées là-bas. Je suis tout le temps au théâtre. C'est devenu vraiment une passion. Et j'ai découvert l'opéra aussi. Je l'appréci de plus en plus. Et puis... Oui maintenant j'ai l'impression que je m'aurions très vocalement plus tôt. Au côté de l'opéra. Alors que c'était pas du tout le cas au départ quand j'ai commencé le chant. Parce qu'alors j'aimerais quand même vous poser une question. Vous êtes toutes des choristes qui faites du chant en pris thé. Oui. Mais en amateur. En amateur. En amateur. En amateur. Mais enfin vous travaillez le chant avec un professeur. Voilà. Tout à fait. Moi j'ai quand même plus partit du côté professionel. J'ai fa un diplôme conservatoire. Et puis maintenant j'essaye de travailler la voix. Mais c'est difficile de s'orienter quand on fait ce métier là. De savoir canaliser ce qu'on veut faire. Parce qu'on a tendence à se disperser. Et puis on sait très bien qu'une carrière. Moi je parle pas de carrière pour moi. Mais qu'il faut quand même mettre très disciplinez dans ce qu'on fait. Ah alors là ça c'est le point. J'ai pas le point noir mais enfin. Oui c'est le point noir. C'est une entrée dans les ordres. Si on fait ça d'une manière professionnelle. Absolument. Et c'est renoncer à pas mal de choses. À tout. Beaucoup de choses à créer. À tout. Catherine Azad à tout. Oui. Pour avoir approcher. Non mais Dieu merci. Il y a des exceptions mais il faut voir. Le marché est imputoyable. Tout à fait. C'est clair mais je crois que t'exagère un peu. Parce que si on n'a pas d'apport extérieur. Moi c'est mon avis. Et il m'arrange on est d'accord. Mais je pense qu'on ayons beaucoup de choses à côté. On ayons beaucoup de contact avec les autres gens. C'est aussi un moyen de nourrir son interpretation, sa musique, sa façon de faire les choses. Je suis assez contre le fait de vivre reclu. Mais je n'ai pas l'impression que c'était quand même la pensée de Catherine. Elle disait qu'il fallait renoncer disant un certain chose à se coucher tard. Mais il y a des chanteurs mouzés. Moi j'en sais rien. Donc moi je suis absolument amateur d'il est tant. Je prends mon pied comme on dit. Mais je veux dire quand on est un niveau international. Enfin les quelques chanteurs que j'ai pui approcher un peu de plus près. C'est vraiment ça et ça et ça. Rien d'autre. Est-ce que très dommage, parce que justement le monde du champ est un monde très fermé, très clos, artificiel. Et le chanteur, oui, souvent. Et le chanteur. C'est le monde de l'opéra. Oui, l'opéra, puisque son instrument il ne peut pas en profiter enfin partout les temps si je vous dire. Non mais c'est vrai à la merci d'une importe quelle p'tit virus qui va s'agit teotro dégozé. Des émotions, de l'humidité, de la vie privée. Si bien qu'enfin maintenant il me semble de moins en moins. En tout cas il y a encore quelques années on avait souvent cette espèce de ces phénomènes. Merveille de la nature qui vivait plus pour leur organ que pour la musique. Fin on a des caricatures assez célèbres dans la musique. Bon j'ai pas me faché avec une moite et de la population mais c'est vrai que on je crois on a des noms. Bon écoutez on aimerait bien faire écouter quelque chose aux auditeurs. Qu'est-ce qu'on pensait ? Alors on pour préférer écouter. Alors moi je vous propose la flut en chanté de Mozart. Cet enregistrement a été fait dirige par Armin Jordan avec l'ensemble orchestrale de Paris et nous allons vous faire écouter le fameux air de la reine de la nuit qui est chanté ici par Soumy Jou. Alors qu'est-ce qu'elle chante là exactement ? La reine de la nuit qu'est-ce qu'elle dit là ? Elle est dans qu'elle... Bien évidemment qu'est-ce qu'elle fait ? Qu'est-ce qu'elle chante ? Qu'est-ce qu'elle en train de dire ? Elle est en train de se fâcher. Ah, contre sa fille ou bien contre... Non, c'est par l'intermédiaire de sa fille contre son marie qui vit à l'opposé d'elle donc dans les trèfons.
