You're going to have your fan club, Julien We're going to do it for... No, I don't know No, but call 25011 to tell us what you think of the last Red Hat album If you bought it, it would be interesting to see some more diverse opinions That said, quite partial Which is totally biased Yeah, totally, totally, totally So, you guessed it, we were doing a little metal funk, metal, funk, like that To the black music, so here we're going to do our little rock-black coalition Well, you get it, little hard rock, rap and other black extensivities So, we're going to go over the last album of Public Enemy Apocalypse 91, The Enemy Strikes Black That's the title of the album It's an exceptional album where Chuck D. is the best of his form He's got 30 hits, we thought he was going to stop music To dedicate himself to the education of his children and his family He doesn't have anything, he doesn't have anything Since this last album, on the last album, there are songs on which he reaches the top of the of the hard and of the content range, of the lyrics that are a little more corrosive, even more than usual A more destructive music The Apocalypse, it seems to me, for once the title is not used, we're going to listen to a song that I dedicate myself to Since it's... No, since the song is called How To Kill A Radio Consultants I dedicate myself to all the radio animators who are crazy and who have nothing to do with their job Since this is a real bet, your mouth Of all those who have nothing to do with music and who don't know how to pass things that don't have the same effect as Public Enemy on the waves Even if you're a fan of rock, Public Enemy is a band that you have to love Since it's the only rap band in my opinion that is really something very very very very... One of the only ones who have been given something really very very strong We're going to listen to that, also note that there is also the title with the tracks on this album So if you haven't bought it yet, buy it in a good way, buy this album But it's on the two albums, right? Yes, on the two albums I recommend you the one with the tracks, it's better It's a question of choice, this album is very very very good So it's 91, The Apocalypse, The Enemy Strikes Blacks, The Morsos, How To Kill A Radio Consultant E-Man, Chuck, your record, let's go, let's go Radio control by the soccer move They moved away and got away at the plan and they're get away And I wanna play what he wanna play They got saying what is bumping up cause he's getting something He never do what's good to the neighborhood I swear I never seen a soccer in mind They give the wood the ass connected to the brainstem So I sing a simple song so you can see the soccer in them Erdogan, Erdogan, Erdogan, Erdogan, Erdogan, Erdogan, Erdogan Yo, my man ain't playin' up in Chuck, man Yo, I don't think you heard me, kid My man ain't playin' nothin' Yo, I ain't playin' evil Cause he ain't playin' nothin' Shut up, mother Superbowl to make a call, they hear the yes-shawe A wild up phone, keep on ringing the yes Some singers singin' Well, don't they play the jammy in the daytime People think it's slammin' but the rhyme is hot They got me tunin' The afternoon is effamin' a pee MF only think I see em' out of town and I doubt I think no dissim Up goes the season, pop goes the weasel Damn, gimme rap, no band, I was an expert I know they even got it from the kiddie Stacked in the back, only black, radio station in the city Who grand-buy a sucker in a suit with a slick black hair And he don't even live here Rap's the number one pick, so I draft it I don't give a damn about the other demographics When a quiet storm comes on, I fall asleep What they need is all-better on the on the fuckin' fuckin' chief Too bad the score on the on the back, my word is gone The bullets disappear and I'm not attacking till they're gone The wack the jammy play, they pay em' in a day I don't think I'm gonna mix, so we don't need them anyway I don't know what you're tryin' to do, homie Yo, you're tryin' to play a shout, you know what I'm sayin' We just ain't playin' nothin', I ain't playin' nothin' Leave em' and you know what I'm sayin' You ain't playin', but you ain't playin' Hey, yo, chop, man I'm gonna dump you to do rock, I ain't playin' It's like somethin', man Can I kick it?

A mess! So I've never seen him. So we're going to listen to Melvinz. Melvinz, what's your opinion? Well, I have no idea. Maybe there's a 25 songs album, but that's not important. He doesn't even sing. Ok, let's go! Metal! Metal! Metal! The songs are on the chain, we don't know where we are anymore. God, it's heavy, it's almost bad. But that's their first album. Now they have their fourth album, but it works. I don't know why, it works. Some guys like to test their music. We don't ask ourselves a question anymore. Now we're going to listen to Nirvana, because everyone likes it. I think they're going to like it. And then... Ah, Philly Paris! So, come on, Immobile! No, that's not it, I was watching TV at the end of the Sorcer Deep Switch. So for all those who listen to the radio, you're stupid, you should have watched the movie with Nicholson. It's over now. Yeah, it just ended, unfortunately. I don't know, I saw the last image where she jumps on a image of Nicholson on TV. And the three of them are really ugly. Yeah, that's not true. It's okay, it's a Buddha. She's big? Yeah, she's big, but it's a big Buddha. You're happy with something like that? Okay, let's move on to the slightly wazoo considerations, which is far from our subject. So let's listen to Nirvana, it's a pure, not an artificial Nirvana. But there are two groups, Nirvana. Have you heard of them? Yes, but I would like to know, because I've heard of them. In English, it's quite a New Age, I think. Yeah, New Age, New Age. New Age, yeah. I don't know, because I've heard of some kind of dark guys who asked for... They must have a metal band called Nirvana. In the disc stores, they asked for Nirvana. No, they're the ones who listen to the metal. If they only listened to metal, it would be too beautiful. And the guy who only knew Nirvana's real group would have listened to them. And then he must have seen the little dark guys. It was Udab, one day, the dark invasion started. You weren't going to see racism, you know? By dark invasion, I hear... So it still exists, and I swear, I saw people in the video. Black and makeup. Oh yeah, but I think it still exists. I'm pretty sure it's racist, I'm not gonna admit it. Oh yeah, no, no, no, there's still plenty of it. Okay, let's listen to some music with Paniard, so real Nirvana. So, the song I chose is my favorite, it's called Lounge Act, the 9th DucÃ© des... Okay, Nirvana, Nirvana, Lounge Act. So, the song is called Lounge Act, the 9th DucÃ© des... So, the song is called Lounge Act, the 9th DucÃ© des... I'll arrest myself, but where does she... I'll allow my way through my soul, so I'm here. Don't tell me what I want here, afraid I'll never know fear. Experience anything you need, I'll keep rockin' jealousy. Tell me what's fuckin' gonna happen, this brandy scene makes me fear. I want it more than I could do, I'll arrest myself, but where does she... I'll allow my way through my soul, so I'm here. True, governance, courtesy, I can let it smile for me. Like you're but a common word, turning off taking turns. Don't recognize the hell I cast in fantasy, makes me fear. I want it more than I could do, I'll arrest myself, but where does she... I'll allow my way through my soul, so I'm here. And everyone, I'll never know, I'll show myself what we can do. I'll allow my way through my soul, so I'm here. So I'm here, so I'm here. They're turning, they're not following, they're dumb apparently. Fuck my godotoo man, man, man, man. Holy shit, man, it's too bad, man. It's pretty flip-flop, I guess. It's a nirvana, man. So what do we listen to? Music in a con. But I don't know, what have we already put in? Yeah, it's the Victims Family, a group called Encore de San Francisco that's been around for years. It's the guys that turn around for about three quarters of a year. Because it's normal, and if it's your job, you work. So they don't really care, they love it. They mix hardcore, jazz, funk, rock, everything. Super, I'd say they put in a series of music. A bit of world music, but it's a bit more than 10 years. Let's say... Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh, that's better. Oh fuck, it's strong. Yeah, it's still strong. No, it's strong, it's better. You talk about Larsen. You talk about... Hey, I don't hear you anymore, I don't hear you anymore. Okay. No, stop it. You and Larsen talk about it. Okay, Victims Family, we're done. We're done with the song, the best album. Victims Family, the best song of their album. You're not even listening. Hey, you're not even saying what we're about to do. We're gonna break the tempo with Larsen. Okay, listen, do it again, I'm super loud. Listen to what you're doing. Got a super loud, got a groove that makes a blue-gray lane. Excuse your nose, cause you got so close and low. And too much, LARS, ROOF! Little sad I'm down, Jesus, that's something I'm about. You used to get your way because you say you did it. Kill it out, no way man. Got a super loud, got a groove that makes a blue-gray lane. Excuse your nose, cause you got so close and low. Got a super loud, LARS, ROOF! Got a super loud, got a groove that makes a blue-gray lane. Wow, the things you put me through. A friendship built on kills. Tenor take you out of pity. We just didn't check you up. We'll notice that they're wrong. Let's go have fun. I slow to break the ice. Maybe I'm just too fucking nice. Wow, the things you put me through. To break me down to your level. It's just a myth, it's horrible. It hurts inside the bell. Bounce and you change. You don't think it's needed. It's one more life on the road. See, I hate to see you go. I hate to see you go. I hate to see you go. If you blow the cobwebs off your shell And make some room for something else You'll find just how well it fits. Right up there. Next to you, see me. And what it's like, I just spread. This brand new one, it's once for change. Even worse, night and all. See no windows, break the walls. No more you fight, no more you hold. New ideas will attend to yours. No time for losing in the air. Shows my whole year, couldn't play. No more you fight, no more you hold. No more you fight, no more you hold. No more you fight, no more you hold. No more you fight, no more you hold. Good day, good day. He tried to kill me, he tried to blow my ears off. You cut yourself, I don't trust you. I'm just lying, it's not bad. Ah, what a bastard. It's another song, victims of the crime. Not very important. We're going to go to another thing now. It's the music of the debil, Chicago. It's TAR, which means goons. And it's the guys who did it. The mega-tournament. They're showing us their games, it's cool. It doesn't go to the hip-hop. What a bastard. I don't even have a girlfriend, you can't hear it. And TAR, they did the mega-tournament with 15 other American groups called the Big Ass Tour or whatever. They did the mega-promotion, they did maybe 10 dates in Europe. And I'll tell you, there was TAR, the Godburi's helmet. The throw-ups. No, there wasn't all of that. There was the cow's surgery. There were four or five groups, they did 10 European cities, the Monts-Machinche, they asked for 10,000 bucks per night. They do a date in Switzerland, the road is fast, etc. It was pretty pretentious, but I don't know if it worked. I hope not, because it's not very alternative. Because we, in the Ovalet, we're not very alternative. It's not very alternative, if Nirvana doesn't play in Switzerland, they asked for 5,000 bucks per concert. That's okay. While the usual groups ask for 2,500. Okay, but Jay with his dinosaur, I talked about it, but I think he asked for around 5,000. I don't know, at first, Nirvana was planned to be adopted. And it's really... It's a guy who goes on big labels, and it's the end. No, it's not the end, but he goes out on a regular circuit. Okay, very good. So this is your opinion? I said everything. Oh yes, Tark, he's a cold interpreter. Cold Tark.
