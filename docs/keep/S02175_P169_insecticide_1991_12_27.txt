well, a first question I see that you won't be talking about a red or white but rather about bottles so tell me, father of Christmas, why this change of color? well, it's because of the paper in the luggage all these papers accumulate in a bunch and it's the nature's fault by covering it with a piece of gold and if the father of Christmas is only one it's not a trash so I'm going to throw a griddle very well thrown, very well thrown he went very far so, my first question no, it's not going to go no my beard, little galapier listen, I just wanted to see if it was a real excuse so, it seems that you are thrown into the ecology but you have become a father of Christmas perfectly so father of Christmas, I'll call you like that so for the rest of the debate, tell me is there a mother of Christmas? well, I don't see why there is one why do the legionnaires have goats? well, I have my queens, so each one of them will be well-made so tell me, tell me, tell me what quality does it take to become father of Christmas? so of course, you have to train a lot especially train your hands, it's important well, the long-window, if you notice it's very interesting and then the most important try to know what we have done the rest of the year because I just wanted to ask you you only work two days a year so what do you do the rest of the time? well, I work my technique I work my left hand and then my right hand and then my left hand again I have to say that since I invented the inflatable doll I tend to lose my hand well, I hope in any case that all children are lying down well, me too so, father Christmas, one last question that burns my lips, embraces the space that calcines us separates my ear and then embraces the rest what is your best memory of father Christmas? you really want to know? yes, yes, of course well then, leave it well, now turn around and then think a little bit yes, and now? well, now, it's the surprise well, it's on this surprise that we will close this file so dear listeners and sad people good evening Christmas Christmas Christmas Christmas Christmas Christmas Christmas that was a great show yes, I liked it and now, it's going to be the dessert and what is it? a little pepper ha ha ha ha ha Christmas Christmas Christmas that hasn't even been arrived model is quite handsication of the Cathie the X known my sword that is not like them they are late they are so afraid they say they love the drama of the pain they like power and the domination to have a city at the end of their canon they hate you so much the life they have made they are so afraid that to destroy the planet they come and stop them if in the dark you don't see the light listen to the voice of the heart the voice of love will recognize you are so beautiful they don't let you do it you are so beautiful you are so proud of the light they want to do what they are so afraid but you know they are in hell they hide the damage of the evil they generate in the prisons of the asyls in the caves and if in this world you have hope listen to the voice of the heart the voice of love will recognize you are so beautiful they don't let you do it you are so beautiful you are so proud of the light you are so beautiful they don't let you do it you are so beautiful you are so proud of the light you are so beautiful you are so beautiful you are so beautiful the light more than 4 days of life on 1991 and half of you have nothing planned for the 31 don't make fun of me mommy is here to give you some ideas for the last minute very good I can offer you a disco or a few ball of campagne but it doesn't seem interesting as you know in this period there are a lot of private parties so my advice is to go to a place in general it's very animated and it's the kind of party where nobody knows you will spend a little time and free since you won't be announced in advance you can also take the opportunity to make a break because in this period police services are restricted so you will have all your luck you can also shoot a bullet in the head or jump under the pool because on the 31 everything is well thought out better die than depressed finally, Happy New Year and see you soon Happy New Year Happy New Year Happy New Year Happy New Year Happy New Year Happy New Year Happy New Year Hello The free beaches of insecticide Ladies and gentlemen, dear audience Good evening and welcome to our waves still a preemie of the soft spring of Christmas and full of its viral influences and now subtly the 128 pairs of shoes of the radio staff available all around the studio and in which we sometimes discover some delicacies posed by who knows maybe the Santa Claus Delicacies along the 1000 leaves or Baba O'Rome passing through the twigs and another chocolate mousse Yes, well, Mehdi, speaking of Christmas like every year we celebrate the New Year for those who don't know yet a week after This period of the end of the year is often synonymous with big food and hardly the brown dinde digested the salmon and the caviar are once again in our suffage This period therefore does not give any feedback to the digestive enzymes and other times and stomach The New Year is also the period of good resolutions which unfortunately are not respected and very often forgotten Unfortunately not respected Well, the end result is a fresh boost It has followed us, both of us your dear favorite animators to think about a tantiné simply helped by three sociologists and he is true to attend 35 advertising boxes and a 3-year survey carrying on a population of 356,673 individuals as well as generous support of our concert to deliver to you tonight the remedy to all your problems of non-applied resolutions Well, yes, I said earlier unfortunately not respected but sometimes it happens that it will be better not to respect these resolutions For example, I have here the letter of a certain Jeremy Poshlon who lives in Toloshna and who writes to us to tell us what happened to him after not respecting his commitments Here is the content of this letter It was December 31, 1989 I was 32 at the time I had just decided to go every day every Sunday in the church Unfortunately, Sunday June 9th I fell sick and could not return to the house of the Lord My mother, well-wished to console me, allowed me to watch the TV Oh, great God, not all channels, no Just the Italian TV And so I had the honor to be able to participate in a game called Super Flip which allowed me to report fantastic clothes A superb t-shirt with a splendid green star on the back What a chance, Mr. Jeremy Another example is not a delinquent It's the wonderful story that happened to Mr. J. Poshlon from Toloshna who would never have known all this happiness if he had not respected his annual resolutions So listen Yes, it was December 31, 1964 I had six of them then Let's see my father cry of pain after having drunk his coffee too hot I swear I will never drink a drop of alcohol I will be so happy until the age of 27 or by my guards I would like to offer myself a box of beer or beer I would tear the brand so that Zamel would know it was a delinquent After having drunk a sixth of half of a dozen of these demonic gurus Demonic, you have to say it I felt my thumb accelerating It was then that my metamorphosis was effected I had become another man A better man A faster man than me, the believer I felt at least an unending energy and pushed by just a few moments I felt the desire to pass from the window of my room to the balcony of the living room both of them were distanced approximately 12 m72 This could have been worse we could have lived on the higher floor that is to say the ninth But no My husband was too short My wife was very shy From my fall I noticed there, all the way down a sister of mine who despite my uncomfortable situation of which I was I was slipping at least I believed it That's what I saw A malicious smile and nothing at all I was in love for the first time I was so angry to regain the firm ground and I adopted a much more aerodynamic position to reach this earth much faster I noticed with surprise the very short time that still a free fall but to run five meters I know after all that the woman of my dream exists I would retrieve her as soon as she left the hospital that is to say when I would have found a higher size to the one of my hair that is 60 cm Yes, we made a very nice story He could never have met the woman of his life Maybe Finally Mr. Pochelon made a beautiful testimony As we show it to all our loyal audience also not only Mr. Pochelon who writes to us so many times a week sometimes it's better to make promises and leave this destiny open to all the freedom Isn't it, Mehdi? Yes, absolutely This said I think it's a habit that is good to lose, don't you think? For example For example I'll take my case I can hardly prevent myself from thinking that he would not be preferable for the new year to be able to present my radio shows under my red dance tits simply because no one sees me No No, finally Why? Excuse me, I was not doing it No, it's true, it's not very logical Why? Because you are very good like that No, no, I think I'm wrong If you stop that I would not dress up with my shorts and my dress in blue vinyls No, no, no Ok, ok But I think we are pretty bad-witted It's not to say But well, Jerry will be my mother soon By the way, do not hesitate to send all your gifts if you want to But well I think we are pretty bad-witted Finally Finally As long as the direct who continues to dress up as an elephant we can afford certain freedom I think Still Because What? No, but if there is a cause You did not understand that it was not a disguise? No No, but You have to be careful because we will still be screwed by Can and Kexi, we are already bad at point, bad at bar No, I'm kidding, Madame, the director I wish you a good year I will continue to pay to be able to pass on the radio Well, well, now we apologize anyway and we wish you a good evening a pleasant night and also finally it is necessary to be well, it is your costume a good year in 1992 So, some little dedications A dedication for Alain and a little message to everyone that I will tell you now Dikorante, Bicycle Fante Alashtranke, Omteetranze Speak French Hello Hans!
