Welcome to a palace full of noise. Do you remember standing by a lake? Do you remember all the promises that we said we'd make? Do you remember rock and roll? Do you remember who said we'd let ourselves go? Walking down the tunnel on this particular day, I heard a voice from the radio coming my way. You're a bright noise on holiday, and we're all invited. So you tell me what you're gonna say. You know it is me, see a lot of it is not, but the gates are open. And the palace, it is getting hot. Revolution. What are you doing tonight? Hello, revolution. You mean a revolution? If you're in Lumber with a bamboo or some kind of brainless hunger stuck in Salaf and City, you like an honor among, I'm political persuasion, don't get through to you. Well, the honest of this bonus is up to you. I'm not naming names, cause I have another choice, and I'm gonna get time to the palace full of noise. What are you doing tonight? Hello, revolution.

Well, I know some girls who can sing, I know we're most got a tambourine, and there's the place that's on, well, it's just big enough. We could have ourselves to sing. Do you remember, standing by a lake? Do you remember, all the promises that we said we'd make? Do you remember, rock and roll? Do you remember, we said we let ourselves, we said we let ourselves go? Go, go, go, we said we let ourselves go. Here we go, now. What are you doing tonight? Hello, revolution. What are you doing tonight? Hello, revolution. What are you doing tonight? Hello, revolution. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I hear the devil come to carry away my soul. I'm worthy, but I don't want to lose control. You're taking over me with each little move you've made. I want to trust you, but it could be a big mistake. I know. But the moment you hear everything's right, I feel the fear of the shadows in the night. But in the moment you're gone, everything's warm. They never felt this strong. Baby, how long are the miracles coming? Can you believe it? Take it and breathe it. Baby, hold on. The fear of your coming, you gotta understand. It's right here in my hands, I know. I hear the questions when you look into my eyes. The scared rumors, but I tell you that only lies. This is forever, how can we ever both be sure? All I can tell you is I never felt this before. Oh, no. But the moment you hear everything's right, I feel the fear of the shadows in the night. But baby, the moment you're gone, everything's warm. They never felt this strong. Baby, how long are the miracles coming? Can you believe it? Take it and breathe it. Baby, how long are the miracles coming? You gotta understand.

This town is a make you town, or a break you town and bring you downtown. This town is a quiet town, for a riot town like this town. This town is a love you town, and a shove you town and push you around town. This town is an all right town, or an uptight town like in this town. This town is a use you town, and abuse you town until you're found town. This town is a losing town, it's a miserable town, it's a nowhere town, and I am leaving this town, you better believe that I'm leaving this town.

This is the story of Bonnie and Clyde, in his life Clyde dreamed of the perfect lover, until one day some prayers came true. Drawn together like a bone arrow, enter Bonnie and Clyde, passion levels are at an incantus, like a drug that needs no rhyme or reason. Blood with spilled lives were torn as thunder, Clyde and Bonnie filled the land with wonder, Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde. Fantasies of years they spent together, shattered by a politician's rage, always one step before the gallows, a lust for crime they wouldn't let them win. Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde. Headlights green, please, make the day, in Dallas, the llama of the law is not used, brighter shades of love were turning darker, crick and spook better when Bonnie popper, Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde. The thrill is gone and panic takes its place, hope is going to abide the hour, flashes of light against the black, carefully taking an attack. Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde. The final blip is of a dangerous life, Clyde sees the blood running from his dying wife. Bonnie breathes through life's breath in despair, a vision of the corpse of Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde. They're delayed in the ground before the war and came, to stay together till the end of time. Your coffin, your headstone and your marker, the end will barrel and Bonnie popper, Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde.
