 Good evening everyone, here is your Panorama Magazine. Tonight we finally talk about Buddybuilding with Gilbert Boutier. I'm going to tell you what's going on next. I think everyone is going to talk about other things. Here is the Panorama Magazine, Roberto Duran. Four world championships in four different categories, announced that he was going to fight for a fifth title against American Iran Barclay in the Supermoyens before he was definitely removed. According to Duran, aged 40, his hands were on stone, negotiations were open with Barclay, World IBF World Cup, the Supermoyens. The Panamanian was world champion between 1972 and 1989 in the light, super-Velter and medium. It's in this last category that he had fought Barclay in 1989 to cross his world crown. Roberto Duran confirmed that he would discuss several full-contact fights or at least in April in Tokyo before returning to boxing. In football, goalkeeper Peter Cobel, 23, was prepared by the Young Boys or FC Soler, first league until the end of the current season. Cobel evolved to be a servet until the end of the 90's, 90's, 90's, 90's, 90's, 90's chefs. Finally, in athletics, sprinter Jamai Ken Merlin Ote said that if she was in the place of Catherine Crabbé, she would immediately do a blood test to prove her innocence. Ote said that there was a lot of speculation about this. Ote said that he was going to fight for a German athlete's pro-viseur in a state of innocence. She could take part in the competition before, but she was recognized as guilty, she should have been treated like the other athletes. On the other hand, Jamai Ken's athlete said that he had no particular problem concerning the control of femininity. I know that there is a controversy about the game of Albertville, but I don't know which system would be held for his personal control. I have no objection. Merlin Ote said. We will meet in a few moments with Gilbert Boutier to talk about bodybuilding. I think I know him.

It's been eight and a half years now Okay, and what is your palm dress? First of all I was junior I was junior Second time in Swiss Roman I did eighth in the world Junior Last year I went In the senior category Where I won the title of champion in Switzerland And I did a first place In the world champion For Switzerland, in Malaisie And what is the difference Between all these categories? It's a... It's at the weight level There are five categories, it starts at Less than 65, less than 70, less than 80, less than 90 More than 90 My category is less than 90 Okay, Stefanie Yes I have a question What motivated you to start bodybuilding? Why this sport and not another? I started the team sport when I was younger And I didn't find any satisfaction in it Bodybuilding I fell down by chance I did it by chance At the time I was 17 I worked in a office, I ate a lot And I was a little bit heavy And I had the first and second year That brought me to a muscle room And the fact that I was physically dispirited Was good for me I jumped well After that, at the competition level It was a little bit of a surprise I was offered a contest I accepted And I got a little bit piquérogio And I continued for ten years Is it time to participate In a bodybuilding contest? What does it bring to you When you are on stage under the fire? What does it bring to you personally? The aspect of competition First of all, we might have to talk About the training Because it's the act that happens Training Is what we can call sport Now the aspect of competition Is the performance of the work It's a bit of an exam To see if we worked well in the room If we applied the advice of the diet The preparation Now, when you know what you feel on stage It's... There is a fear We are also happy to be on stage Exactly You talk about diet I would like to know what diet You have to follow I think it must be quite rigorous During the year It mainly depends on All that is protein And carbon dioxide It means that for example in the morning When I get up I will eat pasta on my breakfast And what else? You have a little bit of confiture It's always good No, it's not confiture It's protein During the day I do about 5-6 or 7 meals It depends on the day I listen to my body If my body asks me If I feel I'm hungry, I will eat I will not wait until then During the meals I heard that there were Additional proteins If we missed a meal We could take What we call supplements I took them, I don't take them Is that a reason? Simply because I think that in food It's about dairy products Meat, eggs Fish, I think we have enough protein Excess protein is not good It overloads the faith You have to be careful about that And secondly, it costs money It's the products that are there And that cost money Excuse me, it's Vanny How much calories do you consume daily? 4,000-4,500 How many liters of water do you drink? 3-4 liters During the year? And then you decrease? To come to the competition What happens before a competition We apply a principle Because The duration is on the 10th of the first Tuesday Which means that we can no longer take duration To eliminate the water pellicle Which is under the skin And it forces us to take a lot of salt And drink a lot of water And when I say a lot of water, it's 7 to 8 liters of water per day And we decrease This ratio of water 3 days before the competition You have a gland The gland I don't know the length of this gland Which continues to work as if you drink Always 7 to 8 liters of water per day And you consume more than 1 to 2 liters So you go to the toilet for 8 liters of water And not for 2 liters That's it So you drink the water To eliminate the water pellicle Which is under the skin just before the competition To have a perfect definition Ok So I train every day Because of 1 and a half hours per day When I do a competition What will happen is that I will increase The work That is to say I will do what we call a split training I trained twice a day That is to say I train 1 hour and a half And 1 hour and a half And 1 training Which will last 1 and a half hours So we didn't hear my question So I asked if we train every day And I asked him Because he gave his program The Ethics You still have a question You talked about all these foods Is there a rule to respect Shouldn't you eat Just before the training Or is there 2 or 3 hours to respect What is there When you do a bodybuilding It is the blood that goes into the muscle So automatically if you eat just before You train the muscle that will be in the stomach So you have to At least 1 hour before the training Stop eating And the specialized products Protein You can't take it later For example So currently I am following a new regime Where I eat only 100g of protein in the morning Around 7 and a half hours And I don't eat any more protein during the day Until I finish the training I don't eat any more protein Which means I eat everything that is called Carbon Hydrate and sugar Everything that is not tri Everything that follows And after the training I don't eat more than protein With a little carbon hydrate When do you train in the morning? In the afternoon What is quite impressive in this sport Is that we have the impression that We eat a lot of food Then at 9 and a half hours There is a second meal While everybody Normally we eat And we eat the morning food How do you do it To have all the time To have fun eating 7 times a day Because 4 or 5 times We don't eat for fun We eat for the body And for the sport And without thinking that I ate a lot of salt To have something that looks disgusting It's disgusting But what's there is that it's only during the competition That we do this principle of sodium That's all But now what I always say is that we don't eat For the pleasure of the palace We eat for the use that we remove the nutrients At the energy level Is it so when you're on an exclusive To make a nice food Because everything is based on a very strict regime Is it possible If all of a sudden you want to eat at McDonald's Or anywhere Or to make a good food in a restaurant In China for example Can you afford this kind of extra So when I prepare a competition I'm on the regime, it's out of question During the year when I'm out of competition I actually afford the extra Which is quite normal I think life is short and we have to take advantage of it And in addition we don't have to torture our minds By making our own decisions And for example, go to McDonald's Since you mentioned it Thanks for the advertising And say I would eat well I would eat well, no I can't Because I'm doing the right thing No, you don't have to react like that When you want something and we're on a regular regime You have to take advantage of it It's good for the head And for the body after Gilbert, I would like to ask you a question Because confidentially People listen to us I have 2 kilos to lose So how do you eat? You look like a disgusting guy Can you give me a 2 or 7? The problem of diet People don't eat very well I see young people Who are aged from 14 to 16 And we notice that there are 40 people at the diet Who are big, they don't pay attention To what they eat When you want to eat healthy The first thing to do is to remove all the sugar And fat For example, chocolate plates Toblerone All the fat Butter All the fat For example, take the meat There are good meat For example, in the case of bodybuilding How I eat a lot is white meat It's chicken, beef The meat is very poor Now in the case of beef There is a lot more fat Even if I am out of competition And I don't do any diet I never eat pork So first Pork doesn't give me any Nutritive value And it has a lot of fat For example, in the case of meat You take the garlic The garlic is good The garlic is very good The problem of garlic Is that for 100 grams of meat You have 33 grams of fat It's huge When you take the bodybuilder Which is in the regime Last year I was eating I had to weigh it Every day I ate about 3200 calories To lose weight It's a dream It represents 5 pappajos And I lose weight And in those 3200 calories It's about 2.5 kg, 3 kg of food There was 20 grams of fat An address to number on the phone And you are interested in starting bodybuilding I train At the Altherfélix club Of L'Ozanoise Musculation It's a club that is reserved only for men Number of phones If you want to
