 I Didn't care cuz I was in love when my game told me down to pull me out the club my shit was Freakin won't let me speak and I'm glad my case. He says I was only vegan come on honey I was a being a flirt and besides a couple of same never hurt, but she else keep quiet don't even try it I thought that I love it, but nah she didn't fight so I ran back to see the bomb with the curls You would lay off the beat, but she's just like a white girl Shake it all down Shake it down Need a body hold Shake it down Shake it all down In my high school classes I shoulda worked classes Cuz this girl was making passes Not cuz she wanted help on a test but obviously she wanted Jess Her name was Rita, I fought she a leader I never seen a girl looking any sweeter I asked her out and she said okay so I took her to a party around the way The party was pumped and a gift was something Showing off her stomach and her belly button She asked me to dance and I said for sure Next thing you know is I was on the dance floor Shoulda seen my baby shake it like crazy Moving a hipster to a bionic lady on the dance floor She rocked my world cuz we didn't have what To shake it like a white girl Shake it, move the body Work it baby Shake it all down Shake it baby Move the body Work it baby Shake it like a white girl Shake it, shake it It was prom night I was hip to the scene cuz I took the high school home Come and gleaned, picked her up in a white limousine And pulled up to the joint around 1115 But they was fly, cute but when I asked to the dance She said she was shy, she told me she's not the dance site And she rather just sit around and talk all night Well I'm half the ham, I said I'm man We got a groove cuz this here's the jam Everyone's dancing, you got no excuse Step aside, I wanna see you get loose We started a sway and it was okay But let's just say she got carried away She got up on the speaker to the nasty twirl She had no rhythm but she shook it like a white girl Shake it, move the body Shake it baby Shake it all down Shake it baby Move the body Shake it baby Shake it all down All down All down All down All down All down Sometimes, yeah, oh, sometimes Yeah, oh, sometimes Yeah, oh, sometimes Here it is, a groove slightly transformed Just a bit of a break from the norm Just a little something to break the monotony Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be a little bit out of control It's cool to dance, but what about a groove that suits and moves romance Give me a soft subtle mix And if it ain't broken, don't try to fix it And think of the summers of the past Adjust the bass and let the alpine laugh Pop in my CD and let me run around And put your car on cruise and wait back cuz it's summertime This is out and this is sort of a buzz But back then I didn't really know what it was But now I see what happens The way that people respond to summer madness The weather is hot and girls are dressing less Than checking out the felon to tell him who's best Riding around in your jeep or your benzos Or in your Nissan sitting on the rezzos Back in Philly we'd be out in a park A place called the plateau is where everybody go Guys out hunting and girls doing likewise Pumping at the honey in front of you with the light eyes She turn around to see what you be with her It's like the summers of natural apathetic actin' with a pen and pad I can pose this rhyme to help you out and get you a quick full of summertime Summer summer summer time Summer summer summer time Just sit back and go and boy Just sit back and go and run Summer summer summer time Summer summer summer time Just sit back and go and run Summer summer summer time Slating the day and I ain't been on the court yet Hustled to the mall to get me a short set Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair Cause basketball court's in the summer got girls there The temperature's about 88 Havin' the water plug just for old time's sake Break to your crib, change your clothes once more Cause you're invited to a bar but you just startin' at four Sittin' with your friends and y'all reminisce About the days growin' up in the first person you kiss And as I think back makes me wonder how the smell from a grill Can spark up nostalgia All the kids playin' out front Little boys messin' round with their girls playin' double dutch While the DJ's spinnin' the tune as the old folks dance At your family reunion Then six o'clock rolls around You just finish wipin' your car down It's time to cruise so you go do the summertime Hang out and looks like a car show Everybody come lookin' real fine Fresh from the barbershop of Lotton to Beauty Salon Every moment frontin' and maxin' Chillin' in the car, they spend all day waxin' Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through Two miles an hour so everybody sees you There's an arrow flowin' up happiness And this is the Fresh Princess new definition of summer madness Summer summer summer time It's summer summer time It's a super super good time It's a human song When things go wrong When the scent of her langues Intentations strong Into the foundry Of each married man Sweets to see it comes callin' And negativity lies Cold cold heart Heart done by you Some things left in bed up baby Just passin' through And it's not a sacrifice Just a simple word It's too hard slamin' Into a separate world But it's not a sacrifice No sacrifice It's not a sacrifice Future misunderstanding after the fight Sensitivity builds up the prison In the final act We lose direction No stone unturned No tears to dam you When jealousy burns Cold cold heart Heart done by you Some things left in bed up baby Just passin' through And it's not a sacrifice Just a simple word It's too hard slamin' Into a separate world But it's not a sacrifice No sacrifice It's not a sacrifice Cold cold heart Heart done by you Some things left in bed up baby Just passin' through And it's not a sacrifice Just a simple word It's too hard slamin' And it's not a sacrifice Just a simple word It's too hard slamin' Into a separate world But it's not a sacrifice No sacrifice It's not a sacrifice No sacrifice at all No sacrifice at all No sacrifice at all No sacrifice at all No sacrifice at all No sacrifice at all See the dreamer On a golden throne Floating far on out to sea Who'll never notice When those dreams come true Is that a better way to be? Make the most of the time you get Never look back with regret The future, what will be will be Some things we're not supposed to see Who knows when the great love story ends It's been told since time began Take it all out while you can Over anxious, never satisfied Chimps and nervous, almost petrified The laughing faces on the fun fair ride Are masks behind where true emotions hide Eat your life with healthy appetite Gleam and shine against the coming night The future, what will be will be Some things we're not supposed to see Who knows when the great love story ends It's been told since time began Take it all out while you can Don't give a sign, don't ask me why Who knows what the future will hold Who cares what life means Keep dreaming your dreams Some of them have to come true For me and you Who knows when the great love story ends It's been told since time began Take it all out while you can Take it all out while you can The future, what will be will be Some of them have to come true I listen to regional On 12.8 of the FM band, I listen to Acidule, the radio of the Los Alamos region The music is playing Ain't a love love They're just ain't a love love Ain't a love love They're just ain't a love love Ain't a love love Another screen, another phone call Another sad goodbye Another tear, another sad song Here's another reason to cry You put so much pain in my heart Your love was cold as ice I really think we have to part I gotta go, I can't stay, I don't want you in my life Ain't a love love They're just ain't a love love Another screen, another phone call They're just ain't a love love They're just ain't a love love Ain't a love love How many times has your left me lonely?
