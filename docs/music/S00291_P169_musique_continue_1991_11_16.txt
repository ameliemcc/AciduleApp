 Where will you go? Now we're cold in here today. What will you do? Where will you hide away? A meaning of a mind, but so hard to find. A union of the bodies, happens all the time. You know that. Ah, I'm gonna miss you. When I look at you, honey, I think you know. We've become too much to tell, with nothing left to say. I'm afraid, nowhere left to go. We are, we're gonna make a mess of it all. We're gonna say goodbye, try something new. If I'm lucky, I know, there will never be a war. I'm still replacing my heart for you. I wish you all, you could want for yourself. May the Lord rise up to meet you, as He'd go your way. If you ever need a friend, you're just calling out from there. I will want to help you, come on man. We are, falling to the start. We're gonna take a chance, try something new. If I'm lucky, I know, there will never be a war. I'm still replacing my heart for you. I'm going with the look about you, each and every day. I'm gonna wonder what you're doing, and if it's to the side. You see the love in my hand, it never went away. It's such a shame when people change, someone has to pay. We are, falling to the start. We're gonna say goodbye, try something new. If I'm lucky, I know, there will never be a war. I'm still replacing my heart for you. I'm only for you. We are, falling to the start. We're gonna take a chance, try something new. If I'm lucky, I know, there will never be a war. I'm still replacing my heart. I'm only for you. There goes my money, there goes my lawyer, there goes my lover with another cheap haul. I don't mind, I don't mind, cause he lies and he cheats and he cheats and he lies. I don't mind. I don't mind, I don't mind, I'm back on my knees again, down on my knees again. I never know when I've had enough. The world to clear, that's what they sold, the pearls just to rock in a burnt out shell. Now I don't even try to make that scene. I just scheme and I scheme and I scheme and I scheme and I scheme and they lie and they cheat and they cheat and they lie. I don't mind, I don't mind, back on my knees again, down on my knees again. I never know when I've had enough. So I play the game, I do the deals, I get the critics at my heels. What else can you do when you live in a zoo? Except lie and cheat and cheat and lie and lie and cheat and cheat and lie. I don't mind, I don't mind, back on my knees again, down on my knees again. I never know when I've had enough.

Two young cops handing out a meeting, know how to hurt and leave no mark. Down in the hot-blooded bar of the hotel, let's call for the last round of the day. Push back the stool, take that elevator right, and fall in bed and kick my shoes away. Kick my shoes away, kick my shoes away. Rocks on the road. Can't stay till the wild sound of the city. Here a car full of young boys heading for a fight. Longest of his telephone, keeps running out of gauge. Wonder who you're talking with tonight. Talking with the night. You're talking with the night. Rocks on the road. Yeah. Tired of coming, wakes me in the morning. The shower runs hot, the front is cold, playing with me. I'm up for the downside, life's a fictional and stuff. So come and shake some apples from my tree. I have to pay for my minibar manners. I'd like to phone bill overload. Well, how about some heavy road movies? Rocks on the road. On the road. Rocks on the road. Rocks on the road. Crumbs on a breakfast table. And a million other little things to spoil my day. How about a little light music? To chase it all the way. To chase it all the way. To chase it all the way. To chase it all the way. To chase it all the way. To chase it all the way. To chase it all the way. To chase it all the way. There's a black cat down on the quayside. Ships lie its green eyes glowing in the dark. Two young cops handing out a meeting. Know how to hurt and leave no mark. Down in the heart of the bar of the hotel. There's a call for the last round of the day. Push back the stoop, take that elevator ride. Fall in bed and kick my shoes away. Kick my shoes away. Kick my shoes away. Rocks on the road.
