 you you you you and good evening we are here again for a new and terrifying edition of the innable shadows of night and yes you know me well I'm back it's not a costume once I have to do something else for example the marines of your game watch the tv at the beginning of a little whisky well if you are already intelligent you have chosen not to watch the tv to listen to us, to the Fidelopest bravo, you are real intellectual yes intellectual, masochist and well you have to suffer to be intelligent yes yes, so you will suffer you have not already suffered from the beginning yes it was the, by the way, a surprise, the wedding present a supermoto instrument from the last rave maxi which looks very strongly like a group we will not name which has a lot of success it's the pixie a little more 60s an excellent maxi we will pass you an extract of this maxi but in another maxi of the wedding present you will see that they are enough to help during the maxi yes absolutely that's why I find it a group that has made many progress for their first disc that was still quite how to say yes absolutely in the underground velvet genre of the eighties and there they really started to do some kind of research sound quite bizarre they are still doing their own thing keeping their style with this chuteur, you are not a chuteur it's just a chuteur a chuteur that can seem like a supporter but with whom we get used to it yes well enough blablabla, we will go straight to the album of the last month the bomb that comes so far for once a group what can we say an alternative a depondo, here a group of depondo more a depondo since they signed on a big label which is the other than Gaffan yes there you go, good a group of depodos, they are both and they still have to do things well, they have not yet become completely commercial so it's Nirvana I think you already have a lot of extras but the fabulous extraordinary in all spirit of I don't know I don't know anymore you know but then we will go to another extract of this album that can be appreciated by everyone because we find it hardcore, we find it pop, folk ballads even new even influence music of the septuplets it's really a fabulous disc which is absolutely dominated by the voice absolutely impressive of the singer very original, very melodic it was called Auto, an old fan that is called a fan of Cure you understood everything we will immediately listen to this track Drain You which is one of the most accessible tracks of the album but which remains a great pearl how about this Nirvana album which also has the particularity of having more beautiful poetry already said, it's this beautiful baby shot by Arjun because he jumps into a pool and for the shot to the viewer a little bad, a slide a ticket the sound of the goal d at the end of the song the track is we will listen to the next number of Nirvana Drain You by Nirvana it was fabulous, Nirvana we forgot to specify that it goes to the concert by the way we have a game called the return we have a new chat 16 in another club New York we have not received anything written we have a lot of memories if someone knows or knows where the exact words are we can give you some information I don't know if Philippe listens to us maybe he will be the last one to add I'm sorry I'm sorry, it's your phone now we will listen we will stop talking to talk a beautiful song by Big Chief we are in the hardcore field it's pretty sub and violent Big Chief to Brian Big Chief is a whole group amateur Luxury the singer absolutely immo and all that and in addition it's a BD fan he only lives for BD mmm a nice guy so the group we are going to talk about we know absolutely nothing about them all we know is what they call Rake and who comes sound or a tip because boss there is a oven but there is nothing written on it there is the disc that nothing written on it and a disc inside the disc mmm it seems to be made of Fairfax and an address I don't know if it must be found on a catalogue of Roloum and it's a music extreme movie it's recorded in conditions disgusting we don't even notice a melody behind all this noise it's so much he plays hard maybe we can't pass a piece of his music just to give you an idea if you like it for your general culture so Rake R-A-K-E it's not like it's called the disc is not even called the song we don't know anything so Rake Rake R-A-K-E R-A-K-E R-A-K-E it was Rake we didn't pass a piece of our music maybe you don't like it if you are interested you can buy a disc but we don't have it you can also find it we can find it we can buy the only example that will kill us by the way it's an R well now we will go to something more listenable to make you feel the nostalgia we are now going to a group that defends it a shooter that has lost his nature it's the famous Gene Fajicci do you know Gene Fajicci I hope you may know the Will Kids Will Kids is a group of westerns westerns is a city like everyone the dry is very prolific at the time the standard with the Hitchhiker later there was the Will Kids with the Delphiagos now there is the famous group that we won't like there is the Buston the Pixies the other group is the Galaxy the Buston the Galaxy is the most talked about the Flash I think they are dissing each other yes I think they are getting something the bassist, the guitarist we will come back always is it always when we will listen to a song in the most famous albums of Will Kids in Paris it's a live live in Paris because the Ridkeys have a lot of stuff that we already said in this live very well recorded surprising because as the Ridkeys were recorded there is really sub-materials sub-products this time they are good but unfortunately it's a live effect there will never be a real Ridkeys when it's well produced in fact we have the Hitchhiker called How Can The Girl with a particular spelling since it's all kinds of girls but here it's the spelling of Will Kids all kinds of girls neither written nor spoken nor even shouted but it's still a beautiful melody you have the thing about the Houtaoudre on the chorus the chorus is in French the Houtaoudre is a dear Hitchhiker who cries out to the crowd it's a very particular song and you want to prove that he was able to adapt to a new country it's not very successful because he left I came back and he's got a lot of energy nostalgia and the Will Kids who interpret all kinds of girls it was an extra live album of Will Kids we have a lot of nostalgia the Houtaoudre we don't even have old albums oh yes we'll see we'll see that later just to announce that there will be the Vernier Surrock festival which won't be held in Vernier it's a mistake in fact the Vernier Surrock festival will have been held in Lignan in Geneva and there will be this Thursday this November with the first part then the next day with the first part we can go on but among the first part there is The Swel Carlos Carlos has been on the show but not for long enough because he came to see the Element of Crime he's shy he's not a major it's not a bad band they play the trumpet like genuine on Saturday so on November 9th always on the Stadia in Lignan there will be La Frontera in the Spanish band and the Godfathers sorry not that it's bad not the Godfathers and the Godfathers who are me they understand the bass and then there will be the Learn they are a young band it's not bad at all the Learn is not quite as easy as the city they have a singer who looks like de Goudau to Grosseau I don't remember French duetist called Grosseau and Maudot who played in the 7th Company he's usually bigger the singer looks like de Goudau to this type imagine Grosseau doing rock I put the word Grosseau and Maudot Grosseau and Grosseau Maudot is the first and the first part is also a part of the Carlspeche the Zanois the support here is Maudot where is he he has to be a secret he plays everywhere he wins the contest he won the rockin he won the first part and he wins again the Marlboro contest they are 2nd it's like they had it there were only hard groups even if they lose they have a lot of money they have a good news for the Zanois rockers well they are all jealous the Zanois rockers are crazy they are very hypocrite so they say good news for the Zanois what's the news? it's Teenage Fan Club I went to London I was very impressed but I saw Teenage Fan Club and I have to admit it was a bit of a joke because we expect to see a group they influenced by Lemonheads but not Fabuleau it takes all the emotion it becomes a wonderful Zanois and they are all jealous we don't have any English style we have better we have better Manchester but they don't have better Manchester and then Fabuleau with a 20 minute replay showing their hit everything flows which would have been better Fabuleau they will be very good I will go to Zurich we can go to the Crams I will go to the first Friday but after that I think it's worth it I will go to the Crams I see Teenage Fan Club it's a very different music Teenage Fan Club just with the go-drills a bit pathetic it makes it weird but we don't have to crash we loved it but now it's more than that they are very good they are full of emotions like the last album Maxie who prefigures the real album the real album because The King made the previous album it was a kind of farce they are in the studio they are one of the best but it was not bad I told him that the album was supposed to be distributed at a very good price The King and now it's 25$ they decided to release the album they decided to release the album we see that the album is almost at the most expensive in the world because there is a story they have re-made the album and this album should be destroyed it's not if it's still old it's a good thing we don't know anything we want to say more about the truth we already know the title of the next album called Bandwagonesque it's a promise Maxie who prefigures the album it's called The Concept what concept is it we don't know Pop the sound effect is very pop every disc is very pop except for a noise it's an extra of Maxie The King the best sound of Maxie The King the limit I bought this one at least it's really good we listen to this title this concept which is even more pop and even more pretty yeah it was over it was very fad Maxie is absolutely fabulous the sports absolutely we can talk about all the songs because we have to leave them for the next we don't have a full season what are we going to listen to now we are going to listen to the group that we can compare the most Tinech Fan Club rather than the Tinech Fan Club it would be better to compare this group to ask if they are really inspired yes because between the first Tinech Fan Club and the second there is a lot of disc listening yes they are the LEMONELS yes unlike the Tinech Fan Club which are E.C.S. they are american they they have a weird career because we don't hear about the two there are a lot of buttons there are some separation rumors they are separated they are reformed I mean the singer who can be this group who writes about everything and I think the others we say are you from there or there are films to do I don't know exactly if they make regular words they leave the group last time they were reformed they were not that rich they seem fabulous we have to forget but all those who have seen received a buff a bad timidity considering what they do like amusement people can come to listen we don't understand when we listen to these discs they are the quintessos of the old artco yes exactly they started to talk about this old disc but they knew everything and now they do what we are going to listen to I think it's a bit of a different genre I put this song which is a song from a song called who is called who is a Wagner the song of the sevens you know it's but I think it's signed by nobody it's traditional it's traditional but it's not written on this album on this Maxx called who I recommend a new song from the new kid step by step ridiculous there are two fabulous songs but they are exactly the same there is no one who plays the guitar no not at all there is just this song which is very short who is called but if you have nothing of the Maldives you buy the album Lovey who is a masterpiece if you like the Maldives you buy the others without you now the Maldives that's it the Maldives, we do more our mission, I would like to do a mission without them I think it's a bit of a problem because it's one of the best things that never came out last year we will come back to the news we will follow Ramon to go to Frisson Frisson is offering us a new song Saturday I think Element of Crime and so on do you want to talk about Carlos who was an expert in Element of Crime we will pay him do you want to talk about Element of Crime pay him, thank you yes, you're welcome let's say I'm going to be nice I'm quite bored I'm quite bored as long as we're together I really didn't follow anything because it was really not it was boring to say we had the same C11 Smiles Davis, it's a lie he didn't want to subscribe, it's a lie because we had the joy of seeing them a few years ago in the MAD it was also pretty painful, we had to hold more songs, a kind of white-ish between completely a bit of himself I think he's always confused I think he's a bit of a rave in this country, in Germany yes and the biggest part of the concert the singer to sing in German which sums up the last album I think they took a completely opposite direction they were fascinated by the reprise of Brecht festival Brecht, short of Veil a bit of Cabaret Mark Almond So Friday, Frisson also offers us Almonds, Stan Redfox but it looks better it looks a bit more rock even a bit punk after the description which I don't know first part the massive Swiss, Bernaut which also make punk 60s it's written pretty badly in the first part I don't know more than you then there will be Steele Pulse an old reggae band it's been known for a long time so I think but once they existed they made music styles we know now but they want a lot of avocados on the other for those who like reggae and in the first part there will also be a band which also makes reggae later there will be a blues festival but we will talk about it and also Soul Family Sensation which also goes to Dolce Vita and Firehose so that's worth going to I don't like it so much Firehose for those who don't know is the Minutemen, the show-autor after the death of the show-autor and for the rest of it you know the Minutemen are in continuous with a new guitarist and they closed Firehose you have to be hardcore a few years ago it was by Jaws it's very special but it's worth it and they have strange things they show me I don't know if it's a real good reason to see them in the show the show-autor is a taste test because he only wears a leather shirt absolutely incredible I hope so you're a wimp who doesn't wear leather shoes well by the way just one last thing for those who would have missed your band and squad at Dolce Vita they will go on the 8th of December for all the fans of band and squad who are on the stage and if you have seen Dolce Vita it's very good you don't have the right because you don't have the right it's a nickname for those who haven't seen ok well you got it so we listen to a band called Sidewinders who it's a con we don't know much about it they are produced by the singer of Giant Sand they make classic records but they don't have any interest and this album is called Iqqaqa I think it's found pretty quickly in the back-action of the record store they allowed me to buy it they didn't listen to me but it's worth it it's worth it to do back-action we'll never say it I run a record after I found we'll come back we'll listen to the song Sidewinders it was I go home it's not that bad it's not a side-break but it's nice sorry, the Dolce Vita we'll finish the show I'll give you some points to say it's not fabulous it's been a few months I don't know I know I know for half of what happened to me I'll keep it but it's not great they take risks they take risks it's good but it's not very good but I'm happy or well we'll see there's still a boy who's paying rose this weekend and Thursday it's not Thursday, it's after so you can go to Geneva Thursday see the FFF it's the French Federation or FUNK FUNK it's FUNK their name I think it's not bad it's not bad it sounds good even if it's on the record it's not exactly what we usually listen to we'll watch Soul Family Sensation we'll talk about it we'll talk about it later there's Dory and Grey and Glokenspiel they're very jealous and there's the Tugs they're a small group who start French people they're never been to Switzerland never been to Cheyvita they're never been to Cheyvita well, there's also the Maracas it's a good news it's not bad everyone who likes Rigidberdo yeah, it's better a group we wanted to exist in the Sixties but they never existed but the people of Dutron and Dutron and the arrows of Ouz and then we'll talk about Dylan, it's another Stéphane and Cheyvita we'll talk about it later there's a group we'll talk about it later yeah, it's interesting it's kind of a revival country it's funny it's not very long it's a bit of a amateur but maybe it's worth watching yeah, it's like we're going to be in a movie what? it's a bit like Mike Reimbouf it's a bit like Mike Reimbouf we'll listen to the new song Yolatango who's been in the Dolce Vita for a long time we'll listen to it later we'll talk about it later what's the program? we'll go to the program but a group who really went out on a good path he released a reprise recently for those who bought it, I say it doesn't look like what they usually do it was dry guitar but it's rather violent it's a bit more muscly with a maxi 5 songs which are in the form of a crossbow between Niliang and Isenicius it's a trio from Obokken I don't know where it is let's listen to the song called Out the Window by Yolatango what's the next album that shouldn't be out yet? we're always in the middle of the YouTube channel we were saying that after the the last inepsis we realize that the most interesting thing is the portmonnais I think you've already seen the last video of the YouTube channel but I think it's a bit sad it's not even the title so after proclaiming the love of humanity for the last 3 years they're going to take drugs and ruin their hate in front of the world charity, well-ordered as it is by itself so we're going to go now to what we promised a song by Weeeling Present that I've been looking for for years which is a very pop song which came out as a maxi called Nobody's Twisting Your Arms so the pop song you didn't find it looks like the one by Wormwood but it's very very pretty there was a video that was a video with some kind of ds it was open on a kind of for a woman to wear or for a foot well I'm not talking about this video a video that is not for the hebrics but that is very rejoicing it makes you smile when you wake up in the morning when you give him some cornflakes it's going to be a lot for us but it's very pretty but it doesn't matter what they do now but it's about 8-8 Weeeling Present Nobody's Twisting Your Arms the very pretty song by Weeeling Present you've heard of the accordéon it sounds good I think you've admired the marvelous agility of the guitarists we play 25.000 lacs per second it's an anti-lux it would be the group that would beat the most string at the minute it wouldn't surprise us it's a thing of the record he did it 26 primes by the way he plays 12 strings we decided to play some very pretty songs since we're going to play a group called Hengst yeah, pretty it's a bit pretty it's called Mystery Spot it's the most accessible I don't know, I haven't heard of the other songs tell me what Hengst sounds like it's a post from the country not bad I live in the United States I'm proud of my country because they're good, the USSR is shit and I have the TV by Cobblest and I have the beer or the fridge it's one of their songs and our songs are a bit sad and they also made a record that's pretty old a bit more in the style Hardcore, SST so we didn't talk about Hengst anymore no, not at all, it was about the agility it was weird because they were playing a pretty depressing music and but in fact they're not happy about it it's a very supportive thing because they have a California accent it's really cool let's listen to the album it's called Looking for a Reason you made a kind of humanist music with a message yeah, Hengst is the most ironic group and he can imagine I'm a girl, a bit of a humanist try to find the message I don't know what to say looking for a reason by Hengst which is not a good song Hengst looking for a reason pretty, isn't it? when is it in the next album? it's in the album it's the Melvin it's it's the Neo Black Sabbath it's extremely heavy extremely heavy it's a little bit uncomfortable after the audition, you can hear the album it's so fun you can sleep if you want and turn off the light, listen to it in the black it's not bad we'll think about something later we promise you I'm not dedicated to Philippe because he has I'm holding but yes, but yes he's sick so he's dedicated to this song and he'll be back later listen to the Melvin's in one of their songs it's a very duet effect, Philippe it's really over it was very good so it was the Melvin's a group to discover it's not that it's very well known in the US but here I had a little more to talk about it's more like a group to discover how to discover I'm sorry it's true that this borsso let's say thinking about it it's a very good song let's say it's like a kind of peace in the middle of a wonderful show we listen to very nice things and he's like no but in crisis I'm really pissed but you're very open, it's good I'm pissed because I'm wHaïti ng and then you listen to a little Uzi Usborne and we won't talk about it so I'm really sorry I'm sorry every time I choose the discs I want to vary them all because you're a natural, joy yeah so what's the song it's a group called VatVat Crush well it's actually the new publication of the guy called Creation there's a huge fan club there's all these things English pop very good music there's a huge fan club there's a huge group there's a huge group absolutely fabulous absolutely brilliant they released a last disc Pres Manchester what they did before was really impressive it's a new signature it's an American group we have Providence where you can live famous writer who wrote the songs Lovecraft they're very happy describe the concert I saw you at the first part I was a fan club the guitarist was dressed in a suit the bassist singer the attraction is the drummer who's less than 2 meters and his drums are very good the drums and this guy is bad the thing is he always gets up in every song and he's like a public jeweler he's a very polite English public and he's the first he's a speciality of English he's the good visor he's the good visor he's not like your fucking dog you're fucking fucking shit the next song is called it's like a dick but all this is a great music absolutely great it's a pop music very gay very gay and all this guy who's very good because he's funny we can see he's he's a very sexy cut very nice cut he's like a pink crown with a hair tie he's like a twist very funny very funny people really like him because the more they say the more they get angry they get angry they go to the brad owner to make a call he was very playful we love you they made a call they're part of it a very special group they're all so funny the album is good recorded on a 8-piste not very well produced it's much less clean than the original because it's not that bad we can listen to a lot of songs there's one called Die a little everyday and the other one is called there's too much ass composed by the hair... not a hair tie which is not bad either we're going to show you a song called Superstar which is a composition of the whole group and which is very pop we're going to listen to this it's called the Velvet Crush the Velvet Crush it's really very good and the whole album is Staccato the sound is a little bit annoying because we listen to it because it's all really wet but we see that it's not intentional it's a bad product we forgot to say that we're going to listen to it because it's a very good song it's a very good song it's a very good song we forgot to say that there's a very good song on the cover so we have a cover we have to buy the album we're going to listen to it now you're going to pass us this song first yes, we're going to listen to this song a song that I dedicated to Philippe if you listen to it you'll understand very quickly because it's pretty metal I think it's going to be on the commoters we'll listen to it right away we'll listen to it right away we'll listen to it right away we'll listen to it right away ah, it's okay a group special I don't think it's going to be a big hit but hey we need to have all the taste all the colors blah blah blah blah what's this song it's going well it looks like I'm going to be in a bad mood it's pretty hard I don't know if it's going to be a radio or all the songs I think it's going to be a good one blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah it's good so, this is the album so this is the album I don't know if you can read the title or the song because it's just a cassette it's written Sodom that I had in exchange we give back to some we give back to some services so we give away the buffer of the bag so, I think we're going to come back to the pop every time I think about something I wonder if it's going to be a good idea or not it means that Kritev has an idea of the music no, not at all I'm very confident that it's not pop music but you don't want to I've brought some stuff in the style, I have the plen to place all the stuff that you brought that's just the style I'm going to leave after we leave it to sleep so I'm going to leave it it's going to be a very pretty song it looks like the old fabulud album Perubu everyone knows Perubu David Thomas I'm a monster they just released it's not true, they released 4 or 5 months ago in the album F.M. music they try to touch a bigger audience they're always looking at the stupid words and they're always trying to make Perubu commercial they tried a lot they're always trying a really fabulous cover which is among the shitwaves of rock n roll the album is called the world in college the cover is sent on Sunday it's a great deal it consists of 2 balls of bowling that are played in the word they play a red shock and you go with the best effect it's really they say to the guy you have to make a punch the word is called world in college it's funny on top we find fabulous titles like Over the Moon it's not the same as the last one you have to put the third one we're going to listen to it now a kind of fabulous new boss it's awesome and we also have a song called what's the name of the song I think it's it's a bit of an abuse the song is a bit extraordinary but I think it's a good one because it's a support it's called I hear the smoke the barbeque I'm the one who's putting the barbeque on and it's really I heard this song it's really commercial it talks about the joy it's a song with a lot of lyrics on the family barbeque it's great it's a real magic word it's such a magic word that it's a bit of a surprise it's about talking about his love for Yogi Loors it's a Yogi Loors help it's fabulous when it's produced by the last Pixies it's really cool it's almost a word of Bruce Springsteen do you think about the Perubus' ideas? I think that next word is interning there's a guy here who plays the guitar who's called Jim Jones who speaks his music we're going to listen to the song that's called Over the Moon and next week for a new show Shadow, Soft, Night good night with Perubus see you
