 Music Music Good evening. Radio Acidule presents its classical music broadcasts until 11.30 pm, each Monday, on 102.8 FM. Our city of Lausanne has a museum dedicated to the woodwork, which is quite a neighborhood in the castle of Beaulieu. I think it's even the only one of these people in Switzerland. Maybe in Switzerland, in the world after all. Very well. And you will think, what is woodwork? Well, its conservator, Michel Tevaux, who is our host tonight, will be better than me to tell you. And you will still think, but what relationship between woodwork, which is a visual art and music? Well, during the last summer, the Museum of Woodwork has exhibited works by Adolf Wölfli, died in 1930, at the psychiatric asylum in Val d'Aux-Aberne, where he has been in charge for more than 30 years. Adolf Wölfli, Saint Adolf, as he was named, was a designer and composer, in his own way. But let's come back to my first question, Michel Tevaux. Woodwork, what is it? I feel like the auditors of Acidule are quite aware of it, to know what it is. But finally... Oh, that's one way to get rid of the whips! Why not repeat it? Woodwork is art all over the place, that is to say, what is really ultra-singular, personal. It's art that we have learned from nowhere, otherwise from our own experience. It's art that we practice when, instead of going to take inspiration from traditional models or to be folded in the order of fashion, we prefer to invent our own expression system. Woodwork is art of high intensity, if you want. It doesn't owe anyone anything, otherwise, to its author. Okay, and then, talking about its author, who is its author? Well, its author, you just mentioned Wölfli, for example, it's true that he is the main representative of the woodwork, he is someone who has been totally immune from the point of view of culture. Orphelin is born of an alcoholic worker, a prostitute mother, who has been placed in farms over-exploded by cynic peasants in the canton of Bern, so totally immune. And of his cultural poverty, he has been able to pull treasures, that is to say, of his own experience, which was richer, finally, than that of everyone else. He has lived hell and he has been able to express it. And he invented, from every piece, his figurative language, his music, by pulling everything from his own background, instead of going to a school of the buzzards that would have made him inculcate stereotypes or things in fashion. No, it's really totally authentic art, and ultimately totally communicative, because when you are in front of his drawings, you feel that there is something that doesn't aim at the vets, at the taverns, or at the shops, or anything at all, that simply aims at expression, because we are condemned to expression. When we touch the bottom, we need the only resource to not die, is to express it. So, if I can conclude what you are saying, it would seem that these painters, finally, of the rough art, would be people of the Autodidactes most of the time. Autodidactes are absolute, it's the Autoculture. It's reinvented to nothing. When we felt that all the communication systems, started with language, were made against themselves. You see, what is the maternal language, generally, it serves to give orders to children, to lock them up in impassees, to speak to their place. It always struck me, especially in the Vaudes' context, like mothers, when they speak to their children, they say, come to mommy, obey mommy, otherwise daddy will be angry. If we take these terms in the letter, they say, come to mommy, that means if she speaks, that means her mother to her, so the child should go to her grandmother, daddy will be angry, that means her father to her, so her grandfather. You see, the mother anticipates the child's position, instead of saying, I, come to me, otherwise Alfred Montmary will be angry, and anticipates the child's position as if she wanted to stop her from speaking. The maternal language is often made to prevent the child from expressing himself. The articulation of the I, the mother does not speak by saying I, she speaks by saying mommy, is not it? This articulation is already false. Education consists very often of making the child mute, especially in our context, where we dissuade children from speaking, and then the school takes the relay in a way, etc. So, otherwise, say, the criticism you make, it addresses an age of, finally, let's say, the little child. It addresses a cultural system that is made to stop individuals. I would say it is particularly serious in the Votanist, where the mutism is rooted in law. The Votanist is a cantant where we learn to close our mouths, at school, we learn, we are surrounded by the students of knowledge, and we dissuade them from speaking, from expressing themselves, from saying I, there too. Where the fact that we managed to take an entire population, to vote with a beautiful unanimity against its own interests, to read incompetent, an immense majority of incompetent, and we know that there is a discomfort, etc. but we realize the same incompetent. It's fantastic, it's a miracle of this kind of abrupt education. After this violent diatribe, if we come back to our Saint Adolf, as he liked to say... Saint Adolf is precisely a refractor, a rebellious list, who instead of letting himself be said and believing everything he is said, to invent a language that was his own. I say a language, not only that, it's not the greatest Swiss artist of the 20th century, it would be too much to say. It's an incommensurable genius, who invented everything, who expresses himself in every field, by thinking back to zero, by taking back everything back to zero. Music, since we are in a musical show, we haven't talked much about it yet, but he invented music too. The Solfege, Volffli found it grotesque, the Solfege, as we instituted it, to know this kind of writing of music that is not at all a reproduction of music, unlike what we believe. If we say things historically, the Solfege is a corset, it's a cork of music. The Solfege wasn't a reproduction or archive of music, it was, on the contrary, a set of norms that strongly hindered music, preventing it from being deployed in what could be a living body, an improvisation. From the moment the Solfege was invented, written, etc., music was linked to enormous rhythms, enormous scales, extremely rigid structures. I share this view with Volffli, it's considerably poor at music. A chorus of Louis Armstrong, or a Flamenco song, or any living music, writing made him lose all that he had of living. So Volffli, he used the Solfege in a perverted way, in a very inventive way. What he did, he played music, he didn't have it in the psychiatric hospital or concentration camp, he had to say it well, at the end of the 19th century, he obviously didn't have any instruments, he used a kind of cardboard or with a kind of lath, you see, he could play harmonies, etc. And I think he rolled a paper in a way that made him a trumpet. That's it, it's an artisanal trumpet. And so, it gave him some sounds, he had some ruses of Solfege, but he wrote this Solfege, and it became, because it was a great way of writing, it put on the page signs that rhythmized the page in a complex way, on the doors, so the historian filled the sheet of very rhythmic graphics, which was, we can say, a visual music, isn't it? It gives a very decorative aspect. Yes, but at the same time, musical, I mean, there were plastic timbres, rhythms, it was a music that was sung, there was this interesting transfer of sounds that was transferred to a page, the page became rhythmic, it became the same music, there was no need to interpret it, it was a miraculous Solfege, there was no need to play it, it was already musical to see it, there was a kind of swing, so in the end, that's its music, and it evokes me that maybe, since it is well suggested to play a disc, otherwise the engineer of the sound will suffer, so it suggests to me the music of Armstrong, which, similarly, he also has Armstrong to play his music, Armstrong is a little boy who from the New Orleans who was put in the penitentiary at the age of 16, to whom we gave a trumpet that he could insert in the fanfare, and then he learned jazz, he reinvented music, and when we think about it, the portée of Armstrong's music, of close relatives, he invented jazz, it spread in all the United States, it influenced our musical universe, today jazz has contaminated not only our ears, but our gestures, our way of behaving, I'm sure that without Louis Armstrong, there would not even have been a May 68, there would have been nothing of what is so important today, and that is a genius, I can't start the day without listening to a disc by Louis Armstrong. Well, you risk finishing it by listening to also a disc by Armstrong, and what are we going to hear from him? On the sunny side of the street, on the sunny side of the street, it's a song of revolting black, it means that the blacks at the time where they were the object of discrimination had to go to the New Orleans, where they were very hot, on the sunny side of the street, which was the bad side, unlike what we believe, and it's a song of slaves, a very revolutionary song. That's it. Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Grab your coat, grab your hat, baby, leave your worries on the doorstep, just direct your feet on the sunny side of the street. Can't you hear that bit of bad bad, the happy tune is your step, baby? Life can be so sweet, on the sunny side of the street, I used to walk into shade with those blues on the way, but I'm not afraid, baby, my road line crossed over. If I never ever send back, I'll be rich as a raggy fellow with goal d dust at my feet, on the sunny side of the street. Grab your coat, grab your hat, leave your worries on the doorstep, baby, just direct your feet on the sunny side of the street, both of us alone. Can't you hear that bit of bad, the happy tune is your step, baby? Life can be so sweet, on the sunny side of the street, I used to walk into shade with those blues on the way, but I'm not afraid, baby, my road line crossed over.

We am strong, which was our first choice of our guest, Michel Tevaux, radio acid. We're talking about St. Adolf, Adolf Wolff Lee, and in fact, for me, you'll confirm this need to express what he had experienced, all his injuries, all his sufferings, all his distress. It was a means of expression by drawing. Is that good? It was a very transversal way of expression. Our categories are very close, we say writing, drawing, etc. If we think about other cultures, our primitive cultures, it's not about the close, the close, for example, between writing and drawing, don't exist, even in very elaborate civilizations of the East, where thought doesn't precede its writing. It's almost the opposite, that is, the sages have a sort of corporate wisdom, they learn the rhythms of the hand, and it's the graph that decides the meaning, rather than the reverse. There's a transversality of everything. In the civilizations, said very abusively and in a primitive way, in these civilizations, what music is the indissociable dance, and the collective dance itself is indissociable of myths, that is, knowledge, all of that, it's transversal, and it's symptomatic that artists like Volfli who ignore openly and insolently our cultural cloisiness find this kind of circularity of expressions and this freedom ignore this cloisiness. Well, I would have a therapeutic connotation to its graphic expression and since it also wrote poems. Yes, therapeutic... I think it's a therapeutic aspect. Maybe for you, but for him, it was possible to put on the paper everything he had in him because if he had kept that, maybe he would have darkened it in other things, even worse. I think he just darkened it, in something you say worse, I would say even more vertiginous. I think not only his expression didn't bring it to cure his madness, but on the contrary, he encouraged his madness. He led even further in delirium, even further in normality of everything that was healing, that is to say, to the social order. I think that he still has this common but more intense, that all the authors of Arbrut are actually encouraged in his singularity. He completely left our conventions, our ways of thinking, he was sure, he took the front, he reacted by the front, and the music, the artistic expression, he was more delirious. I would add that this therapeutic aspect that we now attribute to the drawing, to the music, etc. is something that bothers me for the next reason. It's that in the last extreme, I'm sure you agree with me, it's the last extreme that we resort to the art, to the music, etc. When we totally broke individuals, when they became marginalized people, locus, if we want to, then all of a sudden, we come out of an arsenal of artistic expressions, we open them to workshops, free expression, we bring them back instruments. I see that in these institutions, in the sense of mental health, brain-motor, etc., there is a whole therapeutic arsenal where they have the tools for brushes, for workshops, things like that. I think it's a bit late to do that. I think it's in the future that if there are so many people and teenagers broken into our society, and in particular into our cantons, we have schools that begin, at the school level, by suppressing all artistic expressions, all corporate expressions, that's what breaks individuals, that's what's sick, that's to institute a school totally subject to norm of profitability, to norm of technocratic. We learn to count them, because it's the first thing that's abstract, because it's efficient, because it's profitable, because it's about money, because it's the huge Swiss of intellectual development, and we prevent them systematically from being expressed by any other means. We remove the courses of visual culture at school, we remove musical education, we remove everything that could develop their autonomy, their critical faculties, we remove philosophy, we remove all that to learn to count, to talk, to talk languages, to do them commercial and technical. Maybe it brings some performance, maybe we have companies, we know how to use money, we have all kinds of capacity of this kind, but the damages are considerable, the damages are toxicomania, the suicide of teenagers, the character groups, etc. and when they are really screwed, we rediscover that music can be saved, but it's too late. I find it absurd that we make a school that is extended to discourage artistic expressions that we finish when individuals have become infirmity that we finish by practicing, it's too late, it's criminal, it's not often a therapy that we have to administer musical or artistic teaching, etc. It's to embrace all the children who want to draw, to make theater, to dance, they have an artistic field before even learning to write, etc. the children sing as soon as they can draw, they draw they have an extraordinary expression range the school should embrace and encourage this. And I see, even let's take the devil's part let's say we have to teach them to count abstract thought, etc. Even in this case I find that technocrats are driving in a stupid way because even for that, music is fantastic. What is music? It's not the pulse, it's not the triplet. Music is a sound system, it's mathematical reports. Music is both the poetry and the mathematics and an extraordinary corporate culture. It moves all that. If a child is blocked to know how to count learn music from him you will learn to make an agreement, you will learn to reverse an agreement, you will learn the range, that is to say a system extraordinarily rigorous and magical to produce sounds that will make him crazy of joy and at the same time to make him understand intellectually and corporately abstract reports. Nothing to learn mathematics, but to make music is the only way. Even if we adopted this technocratic part we should learn music in schools. The Greeks knew it well, the cradle of civilization, where we learned individual autonomy, where we learned rationality, where we learned to people who were masters instead of putting their fate back to the idea of a sovereign or a dictator. The Greek democracy, art number one was music, art number two was gymnastics and the rest was in the future. It's about changing the school if we don't want young people to die or if we don't want what they will finally, that is to say, that they will be involved. The day is near where they will realize that they can only count on their own resources and that if they feel like they are in a brutal school, well, it's for sure they should count on it. They shouldn't expect that from adults who have been completely perverted and who reason a little like those who have done military service. I did it, you will do it too. One day they will take things back and instead of being drugged and self-destructing they will return their weapons against their oppressors and they will invent a school a little more human. So I think you are attacking the primary school, I would say that before the primary school there is another school called the school of children which is a non-obligatory school but finally the school authorities have put on the streets these schools children who take children between 4 and 5 years and where they develop in these schools of children they tell you that they don't do it anymore after the primary school that is to say the corporate expression creativity, drawing, singing, music, stories, etc. where there really is a lot of things on the child's expression plan. So infantilizing all the schools that the infant school lasts until the university and then there will be people happy. And it's after that things start to say seriously but I would like to say one more thing, there is an effort that is done on the music's plan, at the primary level because the tests have been done I think it's been already 2 years that in a certain number of colleges I think is it a ten, no maybe not a ten of primary schools, your fingers where we tried in the programs to remove some of the primary schools so the math, the French etc. to put on music's hours and there is an evaluation that must be done I have by the way received this department's gentlemen here, I can talk to you about it so there is an effort that is done on this side and we realize that it's a pity to have left things going as they were I think you have made a toxic by these gentlemen of the department because really they are removing the artistic background that's secondary schools the branch options, all of this have been removed it's a lie I think it's a fake information so I wanted to talk about since we had slipped from Vulf, no I think before going further we could maybe hear some music Michel Teva John Coltrane for example we stay in the jazz but then we will prevent the show what do we hear from this you have proposed I remember a little bit but everything Coltrane is great for example Naima who is the singer who is the main singer who is the band who is the main singer who is the main singer who is broadly beautiful for an enlightened singer who is a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
