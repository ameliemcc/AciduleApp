Where does my heart beat now? Where is the sound that only echoes through the night? Where does my heart beat now? Where does the wind blow? Where does the feeling inside? Where do all my lonely hearts go? Can't remember what a good thing happens to me Hiding from the thunder, coming to rescue me Trapped by the hunger of the endless dream I'm searching for the hand that I can hold I'm reaching for the arms that let me know Where does that heart go? Where does my heart beat now? Where is the sound that only echoes through the night? Where does my heart beat now? Can't believe without When the feeling inside Where do all my lonely hearts go? Where do all my lonely hearts go? And one that's sure because of silence Love still survives Two hearts needed one another Give me wings to fly Where does my heart beat now? Where is the sound that only echoes through the night? Where does my heart beat now? Can't believe without When the feeling inside Oh, I need someone to give my heart to I'm free to get it strong and strong and stronger I'm free inside I'm free inside But the pain's less, so help me I see the end now You are connected to the best radio at Sidul FM 102.8 I took my baby on a Saturday But if I go with you, you'll never understand Now I believe in miracles and a miracle Let's stop them tonight I'll stop them tonight You're feeling inside my baby Don't wanna give your black off When my message on the side of the sun I had the dynamite and shaked it from the moon And I told her by equality And if you either you're wrong or you're right But if you're feeling by my baby It don't matter if you're black or white Don't you dare I got this stuff I got this stuff I got this feeling It's over to you and me This ice can is your brother Ice can is your sister Ice can is your brother Don't you think of me Protection for gangs, classinations Cursing grief and human relations It's a turf war on a global scale I'd rather hear both sides of the tale See it's not about races, just places, faces Where your blood comes from is where your space is I've seen the bright yet dark I'm not gonna spend my life being a color Don't you agree with me When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye You're thinking of me my baby It don't matter if you're black or white You're thinking of me my baby It don't matter if you're black or white You're thinking of me and my brother It don't matter if you're black or white Don't you agree with me Don't mind Don't mind I'm looking back You're fighting Stop you Yeah, yeah, yeah, back Yes, right You're back Yes, right Stop you Yeah, yeah, yeah, back Yes, right 500 conards on the line of departure 500 bleros on their bikes It makes a lot of noise at the port of the desert A pack of hell and the wind, the ténéré Mechanical rally, the mad max of bazaar To start again his circus on the sun of January We crossed Africa with the foot of the end So disgusting, the tracks and back to France Arrived this obscene and beautiful game According to the newspapers 500 conards on the line of departure 500 bleros on their bikes It makes a lot of noise at the port of the desert A pack of hell and the wind, the ténéré Passes the caravan and the dogs can't see Under the cars and the beacons there is blood-sucking It's a few storm that we wanted to cross The roads of their villages when you are gone Like little apples, all the leather and steel Crushing in the sibles to the children of the six months 500 conards on the line of departure 500 guignols in their baths It makes a lot of noise at the port of the desert A pack of hell and the wind, the ténéré When they come back again, it's written in a mariole They will make their field sport of an entire continent When they come back finally, it's beautiful sponsored They will take us to the African for a short break In their audacious things, the good ones are well hot At the bottom they are delicious, combined with the most high Dlatego Si remedy pour cela, crushing the doit Bacch improperر, excricz-vous znajdent des sentences we see things without reason sacrifice except I dont know your name therefore whatever towards that that was our disease the italian people if you the London One is just a family and is a was them as well is the la I'm on one month It is also too late So so so
