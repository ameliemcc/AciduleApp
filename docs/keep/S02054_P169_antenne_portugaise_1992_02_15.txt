Benficista Eternal, but immense Who conquers us, takes our memory to the solid님's false This is what I find dear, and with pride in me That in the fields to vibrate, are the salt and pepper peppers We are here to remember a voice, very far from Jean, who unfortunately, for health reasons, has not sung for a few years, Luis Pizarra, will be very focused If necessary, he will say that if there are any sporting artists who ask for a march of sport, we will also do it willingly. Respectively to the port, whoever wants a march of the port will have to bring the album here, which we unfortunately do not have. In terms of respect to the port, he says to other clubs, as you may understand, we are not here at the marches of all clubs, we are in the good of our friend Fialho, who offered us and we have a LP with beautiful sporting marches, always waiting for that day to be a champion, so that we can spread here in our show.

I am the first to see a man at the bus stop for cigarettes and billiards. The spring of life is beautiful to live so depressed the sun shines like the next rain. For me today January is a cold to wash it seems that the whole world is a mess to me. I spend hours in the coffee without knowing where to go everything is so ugly that I want to run away. I see the night in the mirror the body always changes tomorrow I advise you that the old man has to give me. The spring of life is beautiful to live so depressed the sun shines like the next rain. For me today January is a cold to wash it seems that the whole world is a mess to me. I go out there to the hidden ones to wait for the windows lost in the avenues and the windows of them. Half my first love was a trap without green come out in front please I'm in the grass and the wall. You don't see how this is hard to be young it's not a post you have to face the future with a bubble in your face because everything is uncertain it can't always be like this if I wasn't the rock and roll it would be mine. The spring of life is beautiful to live so depressed the sun shines like the next rain. For me today January is a cold to wash it seems that the whole world is a mess to me.
