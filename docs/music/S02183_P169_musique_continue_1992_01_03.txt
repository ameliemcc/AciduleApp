 The sky was the limit Into the great wide open Under the skies of blue Out in the great wide open A rebel without a clue The paper said it always played from the heart He got an agent and a roadie named Bart They made a record and it went in the charts The sky was the limit His leather jacket had chains that were jingle They both met movie stars, party to main book There a an our man said I don't hear a single The future was wide open Into the great wide open Under the skies of blue Out in the great wide open A rebel without a clue Into the great wide open Under the skies of blue Into the great wide open A rebel without a clue The future was wide open You say you saw me twice in a German limousine This girl is my best friend I tell you baby, it all depends on you So don't you

single tear, it must have well run dry And the lonely nights become a strange, accepted way And the years go past Just like the old song says The pain with time has healed It couldn't last But oh, a friend Like a fool Mentions your name Sunny days Drunken nights You smile and say It's alright But oh, the cold Cold rain A dimension of your name Oh, give me please If I shrug my shoulders When I put my friend at ease As I get older It's not that I'm I'm not that I'm I'm not that I'm I'm colder It's not that I'm Don't feel colder Than before I've become So good at hiding What I feel Without confiding It's still the same Darling, still the same A dimension of your name The end They got to know each other in winter Because their lives start in the winter They're raining, raining, raining without a stop No warmth, no tenderness Then they're getting mad The tip of their fingers It's a pain If they see you Your life is so bad I feel they'd like to say You, my accordion Boxes of cold water Your hidden song You, who's begging you When I let you fight You, my accordion You make me crazy It's for good You know I'm a fool When I sing this song In any case, patient love At the bottom of this waiting room Who feels the winter and the old train We even drank wine But it gives me A little its place Instead of looking through the ice The trains passing The people who are pushing I would give it a kiss in 12 You, my accordion Boxes of cold water Your hidden song You, who's begging you When I let you fight You, my accordion You make me crazy It's for good You know I'm a fool When I sing this song The voices who look at them Then they get up without saying a word To blow my heart against heart They arrange their coat Nothing happens It's too late That's why I have the case Accordion Be generous I pray to you A little You, my accordion Boxes of cold water Old police You make me crazy It's for good You, who's begging you When I sing this song I pray to you That you're generous Old police Get out of your suit It's a beautiful story I Try to keep a secret This war she'd never tell Double crossed her heart and hoped to die You see she had this awful habit Of talking in her sleep When she dreamed that night She couldn't tell a lie She contemplated suicide Couldn't follow through Felt the guilt alone to her end As the man loved and trusted her Would never be the same for her She'd let the truth Where she had been No Confidential information In a dream a true confession She didn't need to give away such Confidential information She had to find an alibi He questioned her no end Did this come from some experience She'd had She said she had a wild imagination Yeah, her passion was for him And explaining She confessed She'd gone bad I'm so bad Confidential information In a dream a true confession She didn't need to give away such Confidential information He said maybe it's the moonlight Or something about the darkness But I feel I must forgive you either way With those words she wrote to find him Lying, sleeping by her side Then to see prayer could be kept Another day Confidential information In a dream a true confession She didn't need to give away such Confidential information Confidential information In a dream a true confession She didn't need to give away such Confidential information Confidential information She didn't need to give away such Confidential information How'd you do with that?
