The 20 km of Lesan Directed by C.P.O. The title of this journal We will talk about the flon We are going to the end of last week To see what the shopkeepers Thought of new projects Which are planned to be opened And some users Who come here every day to do their commission Or for other reasons We will talk about it with three candidates The consultancy room of the Lesan immigrants And elections that will take place Of the next seven months To talk about their motivation And their future projects Then it's the Sun's party That will be up to date With a microtractor Made by Charles Furrier At the Sun's party So what people are thinking about this party And we will talk about the manifestation Of the first May which is in Lesan With a very big road The comments and impressions Of some of the demonstrations And we will end this journal With a comprehensive Of the great advice of Christian Jaquere We will talk about the flon Charles Furrier We are going to sell the last day First at Babette Which is at the boutique Maniac And then at Emmanuel Which is at the gallery of the flon We will ask them a little bit To ask what they thought of the new project That should be made Totally, Catherine We will also ask them a little bit What they thought of the alternative environment That was created in the flon And the atmosphere that they could discover Every day in the flon So we will meet again Right away, Babette Precisely, the project is also a bit dated Because the decisions for this project Are from seven or eight years Something like that And since five or six years Since the Ello gestion To start to take over the new flon There is this nice area That has developed there And it must continue in that sense With this mix of artists Of small businesses, of artists And all that In addition, it is a very nice environment As it has never been in Lesannes For years So if the flon is going to disappear Then it will be a certain culture And a place that will disappear with it Yes, and then, almost a soul Of the city Because there is a soul here People know a little bit more It is something that is developing But I think that if we look Precisely, the project is also a bit dated Because the decisions for this project Are from seven or eight years Something like that And since five or six years Since the Ello gestion To start to take over the new flon There is this nice area That has developed there And It must continue in that sense With this mix of artists Of small businesses, of artists And all that In addition, it is a very nice environment As it has never been in Lesannes For years So if the flon is going to disappear Then it will be a certain culture And a place that will disappear with it Yes, and then Almost a soul of the city Because there is a soul here People know a little bit more It is something that is developing But I think that if we keep In the current state With some modifications And so on It is forced to evolve But I mean, there is no reason To change the structures Neither the volumes What already exists And then keep this character A bit parallel to this neighborhood They made us quite a lot of horror At the urban level in Lesannes For so many years The last round It's maybe the tower they built in Chauderon But we have other examples The place of the Ripon The place of Saint-François So how can we trust A decision of the community Especially on a project like that Which seems really... Out of fashion, I don't know I don't know, there is no term Well, it's been three years now That I invested A space in this neighborhood And I hope that this activity These cultural activities Which are born in this neighborhood Will continue to develop I think that the fact that it is Reunited, so there is the flying workshop That makes theater There are galleries There are workshops There are artisanal activities Which are also close or far Also related to culture I would like That this project there Which could be a project Can continue And if the neighborhood has to change Because a project is going to question everything And that all the buildings The current structure of the neighborhood Is meant to change Well, we are told Or we imagine How could we recreate Conditions So that these activities Can start again Spontaneously in the same way That they invested the neighborhood This neighborhood has become A little alternative environment So it doesn't create Like that, we can't decide one day We will put everything in another place Al-Azhan, these same people There will not be the same atmosphere It's still a weapon here Let's say in Geneva There is a neighborhood The buildings of the city Where currently We are creating Something that came spontaneously Here in Al-Azhan So there are political or private Will Which tries to bring In the same neighborhood As well as museums That galleries That workshops Or other activities And then here in Al-Azhan All this was born Spontaneously I came from my own boss Each one Each one of the other people Who are If they are installed They came in the same way Their concertation Without Without orientation Some kind And I think that These conditions are great Well, that's one aspect The other aspect Concerns the owners The profitability of a neighborhood Of these buildings Also concerns the Lézhanois Before I installed I was touring this neighborhood That was my watch And then the day I started to live there And to develop my activities I discovered a neighborhood A French area A French area At all points of view It was a commercial French area A Port-Fran And then today It remains a French area There is no sidewalk There is a kind of Unorganization of freedom That we do not meet At Lézhan It's the only place It's in the middle of the city It does not bother Absolutely no one And at the same time It brings a life That I missed For the center of Lézhan And then I have And then we also made a small Recruitment under the roof That I propose to you now What do you think There is a cultural life That is important to preserve? Yes I think Well, my children know very well And it's not a lot of things I see that there are galleries But I do not know quite well It's a place that is for you and welcome Yes To come to welcome It was not always like that And if it was to disappear What will it do to you? What do you think? It would be replaced by Something better or less good? That's according to That's it No but I think it's very good It's not always new That's it Well I think it's an interesting neighborhood It's already investing No, it's not industrial enough at Lézhan I think it's a neighborhood that is alive Well, first of all I think it's practical to be able to park I think it's good that there are activities Gallery And especially shops And things quite popular If it was to disappear It would be a loss for you According to you rather I am not convinced that The new project in fact That has won Makes us completely lose In fact this quality I think it will be lost anyway Because this neighborhood will be renovated anyway If it is renovated Even with what is currently If we have a renovation I would say a normal renovation The mind will still lose anyway So I think the new project It will still be It will still be quite interesting Well I come often but it's good And what do you think? I don't know what to say Do you know that there is a new project To remodel all this And rebuild something else instead? Oh no If it had to be brought to disappear What would you think? Well it's good if they build other things It's good It's very good There are many young people And there are really cool shops Do you come often here? Yes often Only once I leave the city What do you do with it? Well I buy things Like that Do you know that it will be brought to disappear? No not at all If it had to disappear What would you think about it? I don't know You would be a bit sad? Yes it would be a shame I think it's very good There are more and more shops More and more shops open There is the MAD It's excellent And do you know that there is a project That could make the flon close And that we build something else instead? Yes but it's stupid We can't do that So there is an interesting cultural life here? Yes exactly And you? Yes I agree There are many places that can exist Because the rents must be low Given the local status And these places would not exist otherwise There are places like the MAD Or a local question It's really good It's great And that could not be found elsewhere And following what they are going to do I imagine that it will be things like Parking and commercial places That will not touch the same clientele And that will be really a shame Because I think it will be organized And better and better And it will be better and better occupied There are men's land There are rap shops here There is the MAD It will be a shame We have to see the project I don't know But I think it will not be good In any case, the first one was bad That's it and for Claude This subject is from the flon I remind you that tonight There will be a big debate At the MAD room at 8pm The entrance will be free The theme of this subject Is what future for the flon district To answer the question Of journalists and the public There will be Jean-Jacques Schilt Eugène Ruffi Bernard Choumy Michel Gardeau Jacques Gubler Bruno Seca This debate will be animated by Jean-Marc Richard And broadcast live on Radio Acidule So from 8pm In a few moments We will talk with three candidates Of the MAD room We will meet right after a musical break At 8pm We will listen to Radio Acidule The Radio of the L'Ozan region We will receive three candidates Of the MAD room We will have elections Which will take place next week On the 7th and 8th So, Katerine So, Kandini Sylvia, good evening Good evening You are 24 years old You are in the business side Exactly, yes And Ella Bette Slim You are a female, good evening Good evening 24 years old too And Kabad Mollingo Auxilia D'imprimerie, 29 years old Good evening to you Good evening So, we will start with Sylvia Since when are you in Switzerland? I am in Switzerland The L'Ozan more precisely And I do all the masquerades here And you, Slim? It's been exactly four years I am in Switzerland I came here at the beginning for studies But it was so difficult Because I didn't have the equivalence Of baccalaureate here And finally, when I stayed And then I worked here And you came with your family in Switzerland? No, no, no I am alone And then I am married It's not very difficult To leave your country To leave your family How did you live that? Well, I have the sense That I am someone who integrates very quickly And I didn't have any problems And you, Mr Mollingo? Good evening Since when have you been in Switzerland? It's been eight years Eight years And what do you think of Switzerland? It's going well There are already bad people We find... There are already people everywhere For what reason did you come to Switzerland? I came here as a refugee I am a refugee in the state And your integration among the Swiss Was it difficult or how did you experience it? At the beginning it was difficult But as we go on, we adapt When you arrived in Switzerland You may have already had an image of Switzerland You have some clichés How did you experience it? Did you see what you were expecting? No, on the other hand, I was disappointed I thought about other things And then I came here I also saw other things I was disappointed with what I thought And you, Slim, too? Yes, I was very disappointed too That's true We have to say that when we arrived at the beginning It was something else Because there are three years ago We didn't talk about immigration We didn't talk about racism But with the economic crisis that affected Switzerland We talk more and more We see that immigrants are more and more affected By racism By intolerance And I find that a shame So you think there is a lot of racism With the foreigners and the emigrants? Yes, there is a lot of racism We have to be careful We have to fight against it before it gets too late It's one of the principles of your programme Yes, quite a lot And what do you think of racism in Switzerland? Well, especially now There will be a referendum They will expel a lot of foreigners So I'm coming back to what Slim said It's quite dangerous Especially for a crowd of a certain people Like Sri Lanka Where they can expel them Because we think there is no danger anymore They arrive at home There are problems either imprisonment Or politics They are killed And you, Mollingo, do you think that through your programme It could solve some problems At the racism level Yes, I will make an effort to fight racism But racism is found everywhere Everywhere But we have to face it At home, there are racists In France, there are racists everywhere It's general We have to fight So tell us a little more about the details For what reason do you present The election of this consultative chamber, Mollingo? I present myself personally I don't depend on an association I put my candidature personally And I will fight these racism Make an effort Sensibilise foreigners in the face of an incomplete integration But adapt to Switzerland It's one of the first points that interests you And you, Sylvia, for what reason do you present yourself? For the right to vote Because as I said, to have a better integration So at least the right to vote, even if it's a common one Because you have your word to say like everyone else You live here Exactly I think that when there is a right to vote We would have already done a big step in integration Sylvia, what do you think? It's the same as my colleague I feel completely integrated here in Switzerland I love Lausanne, I love Switzerland I feel at home And I don't understand why I can't participate in decisions that concern me That concern all Swiss people and all the people who live in Switzerland Do you think that the consultative chamber Can make things move a little? So we will have foreigners Yes, Sylvia That is to say, we can't make things move The next day, we are always making small steps Let's say we are elected It's not all of a sudden that it will change It's small step by step It's very long, but we need to be patient and patient I think that we also need support from our Swiss friends Because being a foreigner, we will always be a foreigner It will be difficult to understand the decisions ourselves Because without the life of our Swiss friends There will be nothing, I think, to make things move Yes, for example, you saw that there were votes For example, last year for the European Economic Space If you had the right to vote What would have been your point of view on this subject? So for Europe, what would you have voted? If you could have voted here in Switzerland? For me, it would be a name Why? Because I tried to study the problem a little I find that it is true that there is a big gap Between Switzerland and Europe at the moment And it is not realizable at all This project of... The space The space in relation to Switzerland So you think that currently Switzerland would have no interest in entering Europe? It's not that they are interested But I think it's not yet the time We will have to discuss, we will have to negotiate for some points Very sensitive before getting involved in the European community Especially for the small independent It can be quite dangerous for the small independent And you, Mollingo? It's the same thing, I have the same point of view And a question a little more general Do you have the bad of the country, for you, that it is from the Aire? No, not so much Do you want to go back to your country? I would like to... No, I don't want to go back because I am a refugee I don't want to... I am the refugee status I have never been to the Aire for eight years So I wish that I would say for naturalization I wish that it is the facility for children, immigrants That needs the facility of naturalization I think there are many things to do Automatic or I don't know It's the authority to decide And you, Sylvia, you are Italian Yes, quite You are not so bad at the country Yes, it's quite close Yes, since I was born in Switzerland I am very much integrated in Switzerland I lived exactly like a young Swiss girl No, I don't really have the bad of the country But I still have the Italian in my heart, that's for sure And you, Slim? I have been partying for four years I have all my friends here I have no remorse of being partied And I feel very good here Are you interested in politics, in your country? In every country? Sylvia? A little bit at the moment But not really, because it's quite complicated I think in Italy there are many changes It's not obvious, but a little bit Through the newspapers rather Exactly, by the media And you, Slim? I am interested in politics in the entire world Because we live in a time when everyone has to be solid We have to stand up for each other And for me, what is happening in Switzerland Or in Tunisia, or elsewhere, it concerns me And it concerns everyone Okay, Emo Lingo? Yes, I am from far away The political situation in my country It doesn't work well in Africa I think you are aware of it In Rwanda, in Ayr Everywhere in Africa it doesn't work And to come back to your program Did you have any words to convince the voters to vote for you? Each one of you, speak a little bit about your arguments Your battle hair, how can we say? Emo Lingo? Well, as we said earlier We would like to have the right to vote We have to go progressively I have no promises to make I don't make the demagoguery I have nothing to win So we have to join our immigrants or foreigners To have the right to vote The rights of the children's naturalization That are necessary Whether automatically or easily All depend on the authorities I think that's all But what about the different communities that you find in Switzerland? There is a good crowd, you have a lot of contacts You contact individuals, right? And about associations About associations too, yes And you, Sylvia, for your program? Of course, it's the right to vote Especially the men's voice The men's voice So I find it normal that we can vote And then, yes Right to vote on the humanitarian issue That is, the crowd In a certain nationality And then, indeed, we have to unite We have to be together Ok, Eslime I think the goal is not to win the elections But rather, we have to work together To achieve what we promised And that there are no promises left On paper We have to do everything we can to achieve So you think that voting is a good thing now? It's a beginning But we have to do a lot There is a lot to do So, as a conclusion, tell us how did your electoral campaign go? Well, I don't have a lot of ads We count on the people I know very well Who know my way of thinking And as I just said It's not the goal of winning the elections It's the people who represent us Who are capable of achieving what they promised So if you are not elected No, no, I wouldn't say that But I hope that the people who are elected Will be able to make things work Ok, and you Sylvain, how did your campaign go? Good You were quite active Yes, quite, but well... What did you do for example? I did some flyers I distributed a little in the boxes or the others I put a little in the assails
