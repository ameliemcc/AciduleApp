 You seem to cure my heart for you Cause this is the term of school Inside I think I'm coming up for you Look up and you're still there Inside Every other world you burn in my mind Every other world I say is your name And if you hear the light Even in my dreams can't leave you behind A session running through my blood I can't get enough of your love Running through my blood Don't you cry Don't wipe your memory off my lips Still dancing for your kiss tonight I think I'm trying to break away Cause something just makes me stay by your side And if you Every other world you burn in my mind And if you Every other world I say is your name And if you hear the light Even in my dreams can't leave you behind A session running through my blood I can't get enough of your love Running through my blood A session running through my blood A session running through my blood And if you hear the light Even in my dreams can't leave you behind A session running through my blood I can't get enough of your love Running through my blood Running through my blood Running through my blood A session running through my blood I can't get enough of your love Running through my blood I may be guilty, but I'm still free. I was born a liberal baby. Freedom's what my mother taught me. Yes, she did, oh, that she did.

A race who bathed in material glory Some can't afford CFC free Still pumping out the enemy Rising, rising to the skies The end result May blind our eyes Oh, we're living a prolonged suicide Save this promised land Trees fall murder to the ground Harmless eyes, the only sound They hear, they seem to fear This ain't no joke The pain is real Can we save this promised land? Flowers weep, seas all crying Do they believe? Do they feel we're lying When we vow to do all we can? Save this promised land This old world ain't like it used to be Show me a 2,000-year-old tree What will be the end of our story? Can we save this promised land? Can we save this promised land?
