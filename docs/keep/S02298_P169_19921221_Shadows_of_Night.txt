I'll sign all our audits That Julian O'do in our studio If you want By the way, it was the Felsen since At least one of the best We have Jack No's new shirt Now we don't have to give it a little more The helmet And the other thing is to be used His slip to continue Call We will continue with a new song No, no, you won't talk about it A new song with the authors Show Girl The New Musical Express So it was It was The Auteurs A group in the New Musical Express We don't know the name We make a brave pub These last times I don't know You don't always know A sign of quality You don't even know It's true If we are from the musical express Read rather The new audits review And if we are in Rome If we are in Rome Who in his Top 50 Amis today Give well The brave With In front In front of this The Gruyere Retroue The third position Arrives the group Don Juliano and Fan Since it's about The group Infer Infer Infer We open a We open a We open a A store A local store Since it's a group Neuchatelor Absolutely Grandiose Grandiose It must have a A 22-year-old average It's the old Old Old coulomb Who tries to do The ball of despair And then How did we come To discover this group Tell us a little about it It's hot So they knew that I found myself in the Republic A evening Among the tando And I'm happy To discover this group With the collaboration Of two friends To dance Uniquly I think that I think that So it's not a big deal Public attracts Fools Absolutely But who will attract Fools Arriva for example What is that? Where is it? But now The game You have to Not to confuse Autopsie the group With Autopsie The group of Death metal American So the same name Exactly Exactly Culture What culture is Shadow of Night? But let's forget That the American group Is three times Or even less Than this poor group Neuchatolo Who still has a little Pity to lose But there we don't talk to you Of this little group Who comes out of the cassettes Of the Tazon Tones So absolutely 36 We can't get out Six neon writing We can't get out We can find this album At all the good discers Absolutely For example I don't know if we have the right No no no We did In fact We have to We have to We have to have We have to have Absolutely So We could talk about the label So the label Absolutely great Transmecanic Which is a Neuchatolo label I see that they are Stopping from groups Past and we Complete I read the list We see groups like Megasex 69 The perturbatoes O-sugar Los merdos What is it? Vaporanus The brutal Mississippi Also The brutal Mississippi So It seems that it is in fact Always And each time The same group Who have written different names It's about that What I understood But the brutal Mississippi In sum Are the members of Topsy With another The guitarist Samy at the battery Etc. But what gives Absolutely great things Also Ok So I think we will start Immediately A first piece of Topsy This word So it's I think the piece Which represents the best Topsy It's called Adrenaline I let you discover the words And the violence of this group It's a little surprising I think The problem resides Of these groups Who don't make us list Where there is no space In the space For the person who Program The thing So we will get wet We have more than I was wrong Of pieces, isn't it? So if you want No, it's Tomat On Julien You can call Of these acts So In short This idea We will go straight Adrenaline Absolutely We have a little talk about it Topsy So it's Topsy We will come back a little later In fact If I'm not yellow We don't make any hotels Absolutely So we have introduced A beautiful solo We will get wet again Since it's Christmas that comes We will make you We will dance We will dance A thing No, we will pass you The traditions of the Senyx Christmas It's Santa Claus It's a song that you know well Where it's expensive J.O.R. Esli Hur and Amor To have finally Under his hat A new guitar A car And a pretty little pee You notice The most beautiful Solo Never recorded in the history Rock and roll Quack Quack Listen carefully Here is the Senyx If there is the place Of the midnight Mass We had a good little Concert of the Senyx It's that everyone Dance in the Belinti We would be more often At the church And yes And yes Or then We have canibals To stay the same day Since we are not going So much of a joker style We stay in Plastic Cities With the fabulous Christmas Rock and Roll So we are going to To To To To To To To One two three four Voila, c'est ça les canibals Qui vous chette un Merry Christmas Et qui se charge d'oculerer Les reines du Père Noël Et oui Oh la la la la la la Nous continuons tout de suite Notre festival De Noël Et oui Gras au Petite clochette Et au petit sapin de Noël Qui vous atteont tous Le soir du 24 décembre Oh je vais pouvoir vous réjouir On écoute Une super chanson Que vous ferais choter au coeur À vos parents Puisqu'il la connaissent déjà Puisqu'il est signé Van Morrison Et Mozart Et nous êtes interprété Per les Trifles Un groupe Je ne sais pas entre eux Et ça s'appelle Gloria Il excès le 6 déo On s'écoute ça tout de suite Et nous sommes interprété Per les Trifles Les deux la même voix Les deux la même voix Ils ont presque les mêmes attributs Non pas la longueur de cheveux Oh la la la la Non mais Non mais On va repasser au vraiment lourd Alors je crois que Plus lourd tu meurs Alors vraiment non pas Tu meurs circus Mais vraiment Gros lourd Trash corps Deutab sabes pas Lorsingall Je ase que De Et toi Small Joyeux Noel Shapy Shapo Shapo Shapi Shapi Dada Dada Dada Dada Dura It's so Too violent We got the disc We got the old motorhead We just passed after No no but it was not motorhead Ah I don't know the voice of the emi It was not my disc We got the disc We got the disc We just passed after Yes we stopped And it's so satisfying And we continue With a new group Of this P-P-P-Pound Or P-P-P-O-N There is no U so It's the T-R-E-S-O And it's well-placed Of the English It's not a good idea We will listen We will make a Maxi It's called Wheel And we will listen the third song It's two Circles It's called Snowing It was Pound with Snowing And shot of their Maxi Wheel I must say it's not at all Is there an album in the forecast? It's very recent Theoretically We know the album There should be an album But I don't know In the forecast next month We will go straight to a rare It's a group of Neo Zedongd It has nothing to do with the bats The soup I will have in the day Where you cry It's a group called 3DS And it's released It's a poppin And we will listen the first The 5th song of this album It's hard to find It's 5th Treasure Not 3DS It was the New Zedongd It's 3DS It's called 5th Treasure And now, Juliano I see it's very... Because he will finally be able to say MOT BEAT But be careful, I don't like anything And I never get free of this show Why did she tell us? Because it's a text of Autopsies to change, isn't it? The sentence is 346,000 watts And in the queue And in fact it's not at all beat It's that... I'm going to laugh But it's trash Because... It's absolutely the same meaning Isn't it? No, it's clear So it's a group of Autopsies And it's a group of... 1, 2, 3, 4 Fm Pop No, no, anyway Noelle will tell us We can't go on the Fm word Boud Fm Boud Fm Come on, we listen to the last extract I think It's hope It's terrible It's terrible, I agree Come on, let's go to the show What's it called? It's called 346,000 watts Autopsies Autopsies Autopsies It's a big dios They released a album Autopsies released a album But we can find a lot of A lot of cassettes Of albums like Brutal Mississippi That I recommend you with the members of Autopsies Is it the same style? It's a bit more noisy A bit calmer But a bit more repetitive You have to say it And brave guys, it's a good idea It's a good idea It's hard for us I don't know Autopsies A big group In Juliano Here It's the most big fan In the whole world Come on We will take advantage Of Juliano To evoke the push over chapter Now We will take advantage Of the push over Now We will take advantage He promised us To come back In the month of January In February To listen to them Give them a new tea With all the good Absolutely We will try to come You will be there We will listen to the revelation In the end It's the year of the 90's It's a group called Gravel A single 45 laps 4 songs It's the same on K-Records The beat-app And many more I take advantage Because we know each other To dedicate this album In Pierre It was Gravel It was a practice It's a beautiful 45 laps That I advise you to search It's a pleasure How do you not think that things are absolutely unknown I give you a re-edition Of the first Maxi Of The Wall of Voodoo One of the best albums Maxi never saw It's not even a joke The interesting thing Is that in addition to this Maxi We find 10 songs live And it's there that all the Wall of Voodoo Take their greatness Because we can hear Stan Wee play The most public We put him almost words on it It's really We will listen to a song Really fabulous It's called Can Make Love It's the biggest group of words The Wall of Voodoo We are all good guys At the Wall of Night But we don't want to fall in love with you Because you don't like it Finally Definitely The audience They are really insulting The part of Stan Pham Who is in the lead today Anyway We will leave a little earlier Tonight It's my time We are going to the place We will follow the show The Wall of Voodoo I think it's the actors Or maybe the committee decided to To delete a half The Wall of Voodoo It seems that we say too much It's true that tonight I feel it But I think he had one last month Absolutely I wanted to say hello to all the members of the push-over It's free It's free Biple It's my f**king f**king Momo, you are so cute No, but we don't declare We are not in love I think it's a good thing Is there a show next?
