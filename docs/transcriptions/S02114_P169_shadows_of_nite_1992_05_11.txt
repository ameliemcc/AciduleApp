 j See how it is? And what costume shall the poor girl wear? To alter her clothes, parties Hand me down dress for who knows where? To alter her clothes, parties Where will she go? What will she do when the night comes in brown? She sears once more the sun gets clouded And I ask what the others do and what costumes will the poor girl wear? To alter her clothes, parties What suits and boots of yesterday's gown? To alter her clothes, parties What will she do when the day comes in brown? She sears once more the sun gets clouded And I ask behind the door What costume shall the poor girl wear? To alter her clothes, parties Thursday, Sunday, Sunday's clown? To alter her clothes, parties Where will she go? What will she do when the night comes in brown? She sears once more the sun gets clouded And I ask behind the door To alter her clothes, parties Where will she go? Where will she go? Where will she go? Where will she go? Where will she go?

We will continue in the same style of American Ordered states of nature On a scale which no one thinks about Don't speak to me of anarchy or peace or comry Both men, you're not playing slow decay Or desperate, it's like both men and sentry bee It's not a human issue, entropy It's matter of course, entropy Energy at all levels, entropy From it you cannot divorce And your prophetic modes of suffering And to lose all significance Exjection, degradation The natural outcome of our ordered lives Power, motivation Deformery, fixers for which we strive Something in us and us is assures us we're okay But in our disequilibrium We simply cannot stay in tend to be It's not a human issue, entropy It's matter of course, entropy Energy at all levels, entropy From it you cannot divorce A solid proposition from a man unkempt as I My affectations nature, I can't rectify For we are out of equilibrium and relief A pay of consciousness and death and manual agreement End of the music entropy entropy It's matter of course, entropy Energy at all levels, entropy One and two cannot devours entropy entropy entropy entropy Bader Legion, a show called entropy It's the last 10 songs that will be released tomorrow You'll listen to the opportunity And we'll continue in the same style Always the American people Flown by the discords I wouldn't think of the lemonade We'll go through the Bader Legion We'll go through the blubber also on Tang Records It's about moving targets Which inspire a lot of discords You'll see pretty fast words End of the music End of the music I've seen what's once upon a time When something came to bring me back with I was a something in your head The world is costing me a lot There's no time to change it, it's just in you I know nothing of it One's a time to make no past Another time to trust what I see I'm not even close to my head You're too much, spend the roll It's crammed, there's time, you know it's all on you too I'm like my sister, baby You're one, one You're one, you're one End of the music End of the music End of the music End of the music End of the music End of the music End of the music End of the music End of the music End of the music End of the music The movie Targets Which was playing us Answer It's Tyrell from their last album Which says a American deposit Because we're the American deposit We'll continue with some

It's out for the 100th 100th album Of Alternative Tentacles And there we find some famous groups We find other groups Also less famous For example New Roses I must say I've never heard of this group To be in a group like that You have to have a certain idea of the music So we'll be able to see it right away This idea of the music is not in the finesse But it has to be said that the original Of Dead Canadians was not in the finesse either So the New Roses that take us Saturday Night On the coast On the coast On the coast On the coast On the coast And And W Taste A little strange I I I I I I I I This is the new Roses Not bad at all And we have to go back to the monstrous Of a song already where he is monstrous I'll let you imagine And we'll go through something a little calmer Because definitely It was not as violent as I thought It's a little more violent So we'll go through a little ride Because Ride just came out To a new Maxi And this group doesn't really Give the same day as the New Roses And this new Maxi Is called Twisterella And And And And And Oh Oh And You Will Build The chemistry Vibrations In the brain It's great Music Music Strictly away and As we sigh Feel the

successful It's a concombre mask We'll see the little singer in the form of a trumpet which is made a beautiful concombre mask If you want success when you go out to the box The secret is ride It's a simple mask But don't think that the English are like pop music Delicious Maybe we'll sleep at the end of the day There are also small groups like the Sunshots You've already passed the AVO You've

Inside She just powers up Her eyes Her Disguise And as she feels Disallowed But we're fading No one should Pretend that this was Really now You You make that fool You make that fool You make that fool You make that fool She wants to remember That this was You You You You You You You You You You You You You You When no one really is in it Time won't wait When you see yourself And see the one that you hate When you see yourself And see the one that you hate When the night Lasts forever And time stands still When you see yourself And want to kill When the world doesn't Bend ahead of your shoulders When you push the wall In the middle of a world's fist The big ideas You have Leave you feeling so small I can see it In your eyes You can deal with it all What do you do When you want to get over What do you do When you want to get through What do you do When you just can't take it What do you do When you just can't take it anymore Feel the pressure Feel the squeeze The The edge in your head The heart in your chest Where's the answer Where's the release Where's the real What do you do What do you do What do you do What do you do What do you do What do you do When the lies they told you Where the lies that you paid For sure I see the mistake that you made When they shake your hand And stand your back When frustration paints your forward back Where they pick you up and let you fall When the badness of it is nothing at all When everything's in the endlessness And you doubted the form of the grain and pain When you push to the edge And can't maintain What do you do You don't wanna get over What do you do When you wanna get through What do you do When you just can't take it What do you do You just can't make it anymore Make it anymore What do you do It's a mess Don't get messed up Yeah I see them Yeah I deal with them They say no Blue song Yeah I deal with it Oh yeah That's what you do Hey That's what you do That's what you do It was quite cold We could see the spectators Trying to close their ears Trying to get out of there And then they filled their ears with paper Paper that was coming out of their ears And rolled out It was a spectacular show It was a shame because it was a long cut They had done a concert at the Dolce Vita And now they would think That they only could hear the noise They didn't notice anything The voices were really behind They only heard the noise The concert ended in total noise Because on You Made Me Realize One of their most famous songs There's a 15 second break An industrial break But they did a 15 minute break They tried to empty the room They did a good job There was another concert that was much better It was the day before It was Médanie She played with the Super Chains The Americans We could hear them They did some hardcore pop Very English A bit of MC Ford style The voice of the singer looks like MC Ford We will listen to the Super Chains And then there were the Médanie At the end of the concert they were absolutely excellent There was a lot of fault That's why we love them We will listen to their song Their most mythical song It's called Touch Me I'm Sick Woo Woo I'm a fan I've been worse I'm a creep Yeah I'm a jerk Go Touch me, I'm sick Wow I won't leave it home I'm full of pride I'm gonna give you Girl Everything I can Touch me, I'm sick Yeah Touch me, I'm sick Come on baby Come with me

factory May 23rd So it's a Vitus They look very old Compared to the rest of the SST label Which is already very young Which should have around 30 or 40 They play rock Black Sabbath I don't know how

An old Vitus Look behind Music All people in the street Round to black and haze Kings, Sebastian, Trimlin, Hans Pony footsteps Run behind to a pretty Shadows of our empty mea Look behind so Music Crickets screaming in your ear Comes the pain Reaching for a loaded gun Bringing in movements of pain Suddenly Look behind to a sharon Look behind to me Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music San Vitus is a concert at the factory on May 23 I remember the following of the concerts There will be the Thursday There will be the Umad There will also be the White Lift This Saturday They will play in the old prison in Moudon And then, Roland is joined And also in late May San Vitus Since we are in the WarDruck I see under the eyes A demand It's a mistake It's a mistake, if you want to write us Don't bother you It's always fun It's funny Can you pass God gave Wrakenroll to you the kiss? We never hear it I think this song is pretty good Destiny is a kiss We will try to pass it on to another time Because I don't have a kiss on me tonight To catch up We will continue in the Heavy Metal With a group that comes out a disc There is not enough time It's Sand Garden They are like Pop, Nirvana, Mudany And they are like Mudany, Mudany left the ship To go to our highest spheres And make goal d discs They released a single It's called Jesus Christ Pose And on this single, they make interesting recordings There is a comeback of Black Sabbath Which decided to be really good Extremely good in Moudon And there is also a comeback of Stone Stray Cat Blues But it's not what we will listen to The Single, Jesus Christ Pose It's pretty good Although the purists think it's a copy of the Under the Zephyne We let you judge Music And you stare at me And Jesus Christ Pose All so loud Like you began alone And you swore to me You know I won't be my slave But you stare at me Longer Longer than the great sin Sin Like the great sin Sin And the Jesus Christ Pose And the Jesus Christ Pose All so loud In the Jesus Christ Pose For the throne Like it's the coming of the Lord I swore to you I would never fear new pain But you stare at me Longer than the great sin And the Jesus Christ Pose And the Jesus Christ Pose You know I won't be my slave But you stare at me Longer than the great sin And the Jesus Christ Pose And the Jesus Christ Pose Music Music You want to pay me more To go ahead and reaction And I'll carry you home In the Jesus Christ Pose All by all In the Jesus Christ Pose Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Have you ever thought about your soul? Can it be saved? Or perhaps you think that when you are dead You just stay here great? Is God just a thought within your head? Or is he a part of you? Is Christ just a name that you read in the book When you were in school?

This group that comes from the same city as the Tugs is the Hydraulic System, which are on the same label as them. The label that seems to have some problems in the last word. I think that everything will be fine thanks to the success of Nirvana's album. I think that the new hardcore fans will be the giants. We listen to Hydraulic System, which interprets Hydraulic System.
